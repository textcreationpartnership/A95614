            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here adventured to preſent unto publick view, the beginnings and firſt progreſſe of the Rebellion lately rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within this Kingdome of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And although I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch a multitude of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in my ſelf, as render me very unfit for the performance of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: As alſo, that I ſhall thereby raiſe up much malice, and private diſpleaſure, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my perſon, as my undertakings herein: Yet ſuch is my zeal and moſt earneſt deſire to appear in this cauſe, as being now laid aſide, and for the preſent diſ-abled in any other way to be further uſefull to this unhappy Kingdome, I reſolved to deny my ſelf, and wholly departing from my own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, to imploy my weak endeavours, in ſetting down the ſad Story of our miſeries. I might peradventure with much more advantage to my own particular have looked back (as far wiſer men have done in their troubles) and paſſed my time in forein Collections, or penning ſome ſtory of times long ſince paſt, where the chief Actors are at reſt, and their
<pb facs="tcp:114601:3"/> unquiet ſpirits ſo ſurely laid, as they are not to be moved with the ſharpeſt charge that can be laid on their memories: <hi>Nulli gravis eſt percuſſus Achilles.</hi> Moſt men are great lovers of themſelves, and ſuch conſtant admirers of their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they think they do well to be angry at any thing that ſhall (though never ſo truly) be reported to their diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. They conſider not their own naturall imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their paſſions, diſtempers, or ill affections which leade them on to advize or act things of an ill fame; but are ready to flye in the faces of thoſe who ſhall even in the faireſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters repreſent or leave any impreſſions of them. Hence it is that the truth of things comes quite to be overſhadowed with falſe colours, and ſo to remain as it were buried alive, or otherwaies to appear extreamly disfigured through groſſe errours, baſe flattery, or wilfull miſtakes. For moſt men that are preſent adventurers in this kinde, are wiſe enough to apprehend their own danger, and thereupon departing from the common intereſt that every other man hath in their ſtory, reflect only upon their own particular, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be overawed with the humour of the preſent times; or ſo far tranſported, either with the benefits or private injuries received from particular perſons, as they tranſmit very imperfect and weaker relations, or otherwiſe fill them up with ſuch counterfeit ſtuffe, as poſterity will owe little to their information.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis,</hi> a perſon of extraordinary abilities and learning, a great Miniſter of State under that glorious King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> undertook as it appears by a Letter of his, to <hi>Monſieur Languet,</hi> to write a Story of thoſe times wherein he lived. But I cannot find that he ever ſuffered that work to come to the Preſſe; whether by juſt apprehenſions diſcouraged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publication, or whether it otherwiſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I cannot ſay. But ſure I am, in the ſame Letter he bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaims againſt the humour of the times, and there plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels us, that after one hath writ an Hiſtory, he dares not
<pb facs="tcp:114601:3"/> adventure the publiſhing of it.<note place="margin">Memoires de Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſie,</hi> fol. <hi>45.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Si non qu'il allege pour cauſe d'un effect ce que n'a pas eſte, comme une cauſe genereuſe, au lieu de l'amour d'une femme, &amp; d'une querelle de bordeau.</hi> Such was then the iniquity of thoſe times, ſo abominable and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the true cauſes of the imbrollments in that Kingdome, that thoſe wars (as the Court was then governed) had for the moſt part their firſt beginnings from ſome ill placed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or a private quarrell in an infamous place. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking on this ſubject, he intimates how dangerous it is to ſet forth the actions of men in their true colours; and how bitter and corroding to the conſcience of an Hiſtorian to diſguiſe or make them appear otherwiſe to the world, then they were in their firſt originall.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak truth exactly is highly commendable in any man, eſpecially in one that takes upon him to be a publick infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: to raze, to corrupt a Record is a crime of a very high nature, and by the laws of the Land moſt ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Hiſtories are called <hi>Teſtes temporum, lux veritatis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> de Orat.</note> 
               <hi>vita memoriae:</hi> and certainly he doth offend in an high degree, who ſhall either negligently ſuffer, or wilfully procure them to bring in falſe evidence; that ſhall make them dark Lanthorns to give light but on the one ſide, or as <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> to cauſe the Reader to wander from the truth, and vainly to follow falſe ſhadows, or the factious humour of the writers brain. To be falſe, to deceive, to lye, even in ordinary diſcourſe, are vices commonly branded with much infamy, and held in great deteſtation by all good men. And therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe that arrive at ſuch a height of impudency, as magiſterially to take upon them, not only to abuſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but future ages, muſt needs render themſelves juſtly odious. They ſtand reſponſable for other mens errours, and whereas in all other notorious offenders, their ſin and their life determines at fartheſt together: the ſin of theſe men is perpetuated after their deceaſe, they ſpeak when they are dead, make falſe infuſions into every Age, and court every
<pb facs="tcp:114601:4"/> new perſon that ſhall many years after caſt his eyes upon their ſtory to give belief to their lyes. Therefore for my own part when I firſt undertook this task, I took up with it a reſolution moſt clearly to declare the truth. I have caſt up my accounts, I have ſet up my reſt, and determine rather to diſpleaſe any other man then offend my own conſcience. I have neither private reflections, nor foreign ends; I am now as it were reduced into my firſt principles, and have taken this work upon me, meerly out of publick conſiderations. All that I aime at is, that there may remain for the benefit of this preſent age, as well as of poſterity, ſome certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and monuments of the firſt beginnings and fatall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of this rebellion, together with the horrid cruelties moſt unmercifully exerciſed by the Iriſh Rebels upon the Britiſh, and Proteſtants within this Kingdome of <hi>Ireland.</hi> That when Gods time is come of returning it into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes of thoſe who have been the firſt plotters or preſent actors therein, and that Kingdome comes to be re-planted with Britiſh, and ſetled in peace again, (which I have even in our loweſt condition, with great confidence attended, and do now moſt undoubtedly believe will ere long be brought to paſſe) there may be ſuch a courſe taken, ſuch proviſions made, and ſuch a wall of ſeparation ſet up betwixt the Iriſh and the Britiſh, as it ſhall not be in their power to riſe up (as now and in all former Ages they have done) to deſtroy and root them out in a moment, before they be able to put themſelves into a poſture of defence, or to gather together to make any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable reſiſtance againſt their bloody attempts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend to entertain the Reader with politicall Maxims, grave Sentences, or flouriſhing Orations: That which I hope will cover over a multitude of imperfections, is the unqueſtionable truth of what I ſhal ſet down in a plain and brief narration of all the cauſes and proceedings held in the raiſing, as alſo in the firſt counſels and undertakings for the ſuppreſſion of this hideous Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And that I might in ſome meaſure compaſſe my deſigne
<pb facs="tcp:114601:4"/> herein, and give ſatisfaction even to the moſt curious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors after truth, I did with great care and diligence turn over the very Originals or authenticall copies of the volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous examinations remaining with the publick Regiſter, and taken upon oath, by vertue of two ſeverall Commiſſions iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, to examine the loſſes of the Britiſh, the cruelties and horrid murders committed by the Iriſh in the deſtruction of them. I have peruſed the publick diſpatches, acts, and relations, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the private Letters and particular diſcourſes ſent by the chief Gentlemen out of ſeverall parts of the Kingdom, to preſent unto the Lords Juſtices &amp; Counſell the ſad condition of their affairs. And having been made acquainted with all the moſt ſecret paſſages and counſels of the State, I have, as far as I could, without breach of truſt, and as the duty of a Privie Councellour would admit, communicated ſo much of them as I conceived neceſſary and proper for publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And ſetting aſide the particulars contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt Pages, leading on by way of introduction to the inſuing troubles, which I have taken up on truſt out of the moſt approved Authors both ancient and modern, who have written the ſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I may confidently avow, that I have been ſo curious in gathering up my materials, and ſo carefull in putting them together, as very few paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges will be found here inſerted which have not either fallen within the compaſſe of my own knowledge, or that I have not received from thoſe who were chiefly intruſted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of action abroad; or that came not to my hands atteſted under the oaths of credible witneſſes, or clearly aſſerted in the voluntary confeſſions of the Rebels themſelves.</p>
            <p>Every man I believe will eaſily aſſent unto me, that out of theſe Fountains we may preſume with moſt certainty to draw truth, and that if we bound our inquiries within this circuit, we may well hope to arrive at the true knowledge of the main particular paſſages of this late Rebellion. And
<pb facs="tcp:114601:5"/> therefore though I ſhall not obtrude every thing as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which by a ſtrict and moſt ſevere inquiſition I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up on the grounds before mentioned (conſidering how ſubject men are through forgetfulneſſe and humane imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to erre in the ordinary courſe of their relations): yet thus much I ſuppoſe I may confidently ſay, that no man could imagine how to make collections with greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and more clear unqueſtionable probabilities of truth then I have here ſet down.</p>
            <p>Now as for the examinations here mentioned, howſoever they were taken with all the care and circumſpection that could poſſibly be uſed in ſo great a work, yet are they moſt commonly decried, and held by the Iriſh as very injurious to their countrey men. Thus much I ſhall be bold to averre, and ſhall here ſpeak it for the better authority and credit of the evidence brought in by them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that as the Commiſſions for taking thoſe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were after mature deliberation iſſued out by ſpeciall order from the Lords Juſtices and Councell; ſo they were in great wiſdome deſigned by them for no other ends then to have ſome generall account of the loſſes ſuffered by the Britiſh, and the cruelties exerciſed by the Iriſh upon them in the ſeverall parts of the Kingdome. And this courſe was firſt ſet on foot in the very height of our troubles, when the fury of the Rebels ſo deſperately raged, as they were in no condition to think of the attainting of their perſons, and therefore only aimed at the diſcovery of their treaſon. Out of which reſpect chiefly the Commiſſioners made choice of for the performance of this ſervice, were ſix of the Clergie, all perſons of known integrity; and ſuch as by reaſon of their profeſſion, would in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gently proceed on in their inquiſitions, and truly ſet down the bloody Relations given in unto them. The perſons examined were of ſeverall conditions, moſt of them Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, ſome of Iriſh birth and extraction, very many of
<pb facs="tcp:114601:5"/> good quality, and ſuch as were of inferiour rank were not rejected if they were known ſufferers, and came free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in to declare what they could ſpeak of their owne knowledge. Few came but ſuch as had been in the hands of the Rebels, and could with ſorrowfull hearts make the ſad relation of their own miſeries. And ſo they having been eye-witneſſes, their depoſitions are for the moſt part out of their own knowledge; and what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in by them upon hear-ſay, they for the moſt part depoſe, that they received it out of the Rebels own mouthes while they were in reſtraint among them. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, many of theſe miſerable perſons thus examined, came up wounded, others even almoſt famiſhed; or ſo worn out with their ſufferings, as they did not long out-live the date of their examinations: So as theſe teſtimonies being delivered in their laſt agonies, we are in charity to believe that they would leave behinde them with all due circumſtances, a clear atteſtation of ſuch cruelties as they then bequeathed unto us with their laſt breath.</p>
            <p>But it is not much to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<note place="margin">

            <p>If they could imagine which way to ſilence, or by what means to blaſt the credit of theſe examinations thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly taken, and prevaile according to their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous deſires upon the late Treaty of Peace, to have all the indictments legally put in againſt the principall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb facs="tcp:114601:6"/> and their adherents, taken off the file and cancelled, they would not be out of hope, as theſe times now are to palliate their Rebellion with ſuch ſpecious pretences, as that their barbarous cruelties, acted beyond all paralell being forgotten, it ſhould with great applauſe paſſe down to poſterity, under the name of a holy and juſt war for the defence of the Catholick Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And now in order to this deſigne, they have taken all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to proclaime the huge preſſures which they pretend to have ſuffered under the late government in <hi>this</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſpare not to tearm it tyrannicall: they ſpeak as if their oppreſſions might be paralelled with the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh envaſſalage in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for Religion equalled to thoſe of the Primitive times. And then they further ſay, <hi>That thereupon only ſome Catholicks, conſidering the deplorable and deſperate condition they were in, and apprehending the plots laid to extinguiſh their Religion and Nation, did take armes in the North in maintenance of their Religion, and for the preſervation of life, liberty, and eſtate, together with his Majeſties rights. And that the Lords and Gentlemen dwelling within the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Pale, were likewiſe by the great rigour and ſeverity uſed by the State towards them, enforced to take up armes for their own defence.</hi>

               <note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of grievances preſented to his Majeſty in behalf of the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and given in to his Majeſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at <hi>Trime,</hi> March 17. 1642.</note>Theſe are the expreſſions and the language uſed in the late Remonſtrance given in to his Majeſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at <hi>Trime,</hi> to be preſented to his Majeſtie in behalf of his Catholick Subjects in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Wherein there are pieced together ſo many vain inconſiderable fancies, many ſubſequent paſſages acted in the proſecution of the war, and ſuch bold, notorious, falſe aſſertions, without any the leaſt ground or colour of truth: as without all doubt they abſolutely reſolved, firſt, to raiſe this Rebellion, and then to ſet their Lawyers and Clergie on work, to frame ſuch reaſons and motives as might with ſome colour of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb facs="tcp:114601:6"/> ſerve for arguments to defend it. And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to ſpeak plainly, a moſt infamous Pamphlet, full fraught with ſcandalous aſperſions caſt upon the preſent government, and his Majeſties principall Officers of State within this Kingdome. It was certainly framed with moſt virulent intentions, not to preſent their condition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſufferings to his Majeſtie, but that it might be diſperſed to gain belief among foreign States abroad, as well as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons at home; and ſo draw aſſiſtance and aide, to foment and ſtrengthen their rebellious party in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I do not much wonder they ſhould take thus upon them to abuſe the world with ſuch ſcurrilous diſcourſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by endeavour to raiſe ſome ground or belief that they had juſt cauſe to enter into ſo deſperate a Rebellion. This hath been an ordinary courſe ever held in all deſignes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And it is well obſerved by <hi>Polybius,</hi> that there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be found in all ſuch great undertakings, <hi>Cauſae ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriae,</hi> and <hi>cauſae juſtificae.</hi> The firſt, ſuch as are the true naturall cauſes and really firſt in the intention; the other, ſuch as are moſt commonly obtruded to the world by way of cover and juſtification. Now as the nature of water is moſt clearly ſeen in the firſt Fountain, where it remains pure and unmixed, without any droſſe or ſoil that it afterwards contracts, as it paſſeth along in the ſtreams derived from it. So certainly the quality of all humane actions is beſt underſtood, and moſt clearly diſcerned, when we look upon them as they appear in their firſt originall, before the inconveniencies and fatall miſcarriages which afterwards come to be diſcovered, awake the firſt Projectors, and teach them new artifices wherewith to diſguiſe and colour over their abortive, or otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate counſels. Now as for the true Suaſorian cauſes (if I may ſo tearm them) which enduced the Iriſh to lay the plot of this Rebellion, &amp; were indeed really firſt in their thoughts, they will ſufficiently appear in this enſuing Story. And for
<pb facs="tcp:114601:7"/> the juſtificall reaſons of their riſing in armes, if any one hath a minde to take them up on truſt from themſelves, let him ſeek no further then the Remonſtrance before mentioned; whereof much more is to be ſaid then I ſhall give my ſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak in this place: well knowing that thoſe noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruths and wicked impoſtures contained in it when they come to the <hi>teſt</hi> will be quickly diſcovered, and the varniſh they have put upon them ſoon fall away of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>If any one hath been ignorantly deluded hereby, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be rectified in his own judgement, let him be pleaſed to turn over this enſuing Story,
<q>Verum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui:</q>
            </p>
            <p>There needs certainly no other confutation of their falſe and virulent ſuggeſtions, then a true impartiall relation of the firſt beginnings and progreſſe of this Rebellion: which for what was acted within the ſpace of the firſt two moneths after the breaking out of it, I preſume I may ſay without vanity, he ſhall certainly finde here. It is true, I have principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my ſelf to give an account of what was done about <hi>Dublin,</hi> the chief City of this Kingdom, and the place where the Lords Juſtices and Councell continued uſing their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power and endeavours to oppoſe the fury of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. Yet as all other parts of the Kingdom were under their government, and their care and counſels (as far as their generall diſtractions would admit) extended to the whole, what was acted in all other places of the countrey, comes properly to be touched upon, and the miſerable condition of them to be repreſented in this following Story.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here trouble the Reader with any further Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my ſelf, or with excuſes for the multitude of my own imperfections, which will here appear in large Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; and will be peradventure looked upon with a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Glaſſe by thoſe who are not pleaſed with what I have here expoſed to publick view. I do not at all pretend to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the bitter expreſſions of malevolent ſpirits: As I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:114601:7"/> with great patience compoſe my ſelf to bear the utmoſt that their malice can put upon me: So I ſhall be alwayes ready with much meekneſſe to ſubmit to be reformed by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, who can make it appear, that I have either through ignorance or negligence (for I am ſure wilfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes they will finde none) miſcarried in the relation of any particular here ſet down: Sinnes of ignorance found a very eaſie expiation under the Old Law, I will not ſay they had a pardon of courſe. But if I have ſo carried my ſelf, as that no greater tranſgreſſions can be laid to my charge, I ſhall be much ſatisfied, and may peradventure be further encouraged to proceed on to a continuation of this Story, and therein to tranſmit down to poſterity the noble atchievements and great victories already obtained by ſmall numbers of the Engliſh forces over huge multitudes of theſe Iriſh Rebels.</p>

If wee ſhould give credit to the Iriſh Chronicles, or their Bards (who deliver no certain truths) we might finde ſtuffe enough for an ancient pedegree, made up out of a moſt various ſtrange compoſure of the Iriſh Nation.

And in the firſt place they applied themſelves with all manner of gentle lenitives to mollifie the ſharp humours raiſed by the rigid paſſages in the former government,<note place="margin">They apply themſelves to give content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the people.</note> They declared themſelves againſt all ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings lately uſed, as they found any wayes varying from the Common Law; They gave all due encouragement to the Parliament then ſitting, to endeavour the reaſonable eaſe and contentment of the people, freely aſſenting to all ſuch Acts as really tended to a legall reformation: They betook themſelves wholly to the advice of the Councel, and cauſed all matters as well of the Crown, as Popular intereſt, to be handled in His Majeſties courts of Juſtice, no wayes admitting the late exorbitancies (ſo bitterly decried in Parliament) of Paper-Petitions or Bils, in Civil cauſes, to be brought before them at the Councel-board, or before any other by their authority: They, by His Majeſties gracious directions, gave way to the Parliament to abate the Subſidies (there given in the E. of <hi>Straffords</hi> time, and then in collection) from 40000 li. each Subſidy, to 12000. li. apeece, ſo low did they think fit to reduce them: And they were further content (becauſe they ſaw His Majeſty moſt abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to give the Iriſh Agents full ſatisfaction) to draw up two Acts to be paſſed in the Parliament, moſt impetuouſly deſired by the Natives; The one was the Act of <hi>Limitations,</hi> which unqueſtionably ſetled all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of land in the kingdome, quietly enjoyed without claim or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption for the ſpace of ſixty years immediately preceding; The other was for the relinquiſhment of the right and title which His Majeſty had to the four counties in <hi>Conaght,</hi> legally found for him by ſeverall inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions taken in them, and ready to be diſpoſed of, upon a due ſurvay, to Britiſh undertakers; as alſo to ſome territories of good extent in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and the county of <hi>Clare,</hi> upon the ſame title.</p>
            <p>Thus was the preſent Government moſt ſweetly tempered, and carried on with great lenity and modetation; the Lords Iuſtices and Councel wholly departing from the rigour of former courſes, did gently unbend themſelves into a happy and juſt compliance with the ſeaſonable deſires of the people.

A matter that was much taken notice of, and eſteemed by many, as moſt highly conducing to the ſecurity of the Engliſh intereſts, and plantation among them. So as all theſe circumſtances duly weighed, together with the removall of the late obſtructions, the great increaſe of trade, and many other evident Symptomes of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing common-wealth, it was believed even by the wiſeſt and beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the affairs of Ireland, that the peace and tranquility of the Kingdom was now fully ſetled, and moſt likely in all humane probability to continue, without any conſiderable interuption, in the preſent felicity and great proſperity it now enioyed under the government of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty that now raigneth.</p>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be neceſſary to leave ſome monuments hereof to poſterity, I ſhall obſerve the beginnings and firſt motions, as well as trace out the progreſſe, of a rebellion ſo execrable in it ſelf, ſo odious to God and the whole world, as no age, no kingdome, no people can parallel the horrid cruelties,<note place="margin">The firſt plot for the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carried on with ſo great ſecreſie, as none of the Engliſh had notice of it before it was ready to be put in execution.</note> the abominable murders, that have been without number, as well as without mercy committed upon the Britiſh inhabitants through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the land, of what ſexe or age, of what quality or condition ſoever they were.</p>
               <p>And firſt I muſt needs ſay, howſoever I have obſerved in the nature of the Iriſh ſuch a kind of dull and deep reſervedneſſe, as makes them with much ſilence and ſecreſie to carry on their buſineſſe: yet I cannot but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114601:17"/> conſider with great admiration how this miſchievous plot which was to be ſo generally at the ſame time, and at ſo many ſeverall places acted, and therefore neceſſarily known to ſo many ſeverall perſons, ſhould without any noiſe be brought to ſuch maturity, as to arrive at the very point of execution without any notice or intimation given to any two of that huge multitude of perſons who were generally deſigned (as moſt of them did) to periſh in it. For beſides the uncertain preſumptions that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cole</hi> had of a commotion to be raiſed by the Iriſh in the Province of <hi>

It is true, Sir <hi>VVilliam Cole</hi> upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt apprehenſions of ſomething that he conceived to be hatching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> did write a Letter to the Lords Juſtices and Councell, dated the 11. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1641. wherein he gave them notice of the great reſort made to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> in the county of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> as alſo to the houſe of the Lord <hi>Mac Gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As alſo that the ſaid Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> had of late made ſeverall journies into the Pale, and other places and had ſpent his time much in writing Letters, and ſending diſpatches abroad. Theſe Letters were received by the Lords Juſtices and Councell, and they in anſwer to them required him to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vigilant and induſtrious to finde out what ſhould be the occaſion of thoſe ſeverall meetings, and ſpeedily to advertiſe them thereof, or of any other particular that he conceived might tend to the publique ſervice of the State.

                  <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> a Gentleman of a meer Iriſh family, but one that had long lived among the Engliſh, and been trained up in the true Proteſtant religion, came unto the Lord Juſtice <hi>Parſons</hi> about nine of the clock that evening, and made him a broken relation of a great conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy for the ſeizing upon his Majeſties caſtle of <hi>Dublin:</hi> He gave him the names of ſome of the chief conſpirators, aſſured him they were come up expreſly to the Town for the ſame purpoſe, and that next morning they would undoubtedly attempt, and ſurely effect it, if their deſigne were not ſpeedily prevented, and that he had underſtood all this from <hi>Hugh Mac Mahon,</hi> one of the chief conſpirators, who was then in the town, and came up but the very ſame afternoon for the execution of the plot; and with whom indeed he had been drinking ſomewhat liberally, and as the truth is, did then make ſuch a broken relation of a matter that ſeemed ſo incredible in it ſelf, as that his Lordſhip gave very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to it at firſt, in regard it came from an obſcure perſon, and one as he conceived ſomewhat diſtempered at that time. But howſoever the Lord <hi>Parſons</hi> gave him order to go again to <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> and to get out of him as much certainty of the plot, with as many particular circumſtances as he could, ſtraightly charging him to return back unto him the ſame evening. And in the mean time, having by ſtrict commands given to the conſtable of the caſtle, taken order to have the gates thereof well guarded, as alſo with the Mayor and Sheriffes of the city to have ſtrong watches ſet upon all the parts of the ſame, and to make ſtay of all ſtrangers, hee went privately about ten of the clock that night to the Lord <hi>Borlacies</hi> houſe without the town, and there acquainting him with what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from <hi>Conally,</hi> they ſent for ſuch of the councell as they knew then to be in the town.

But this feare was quickly removed by Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby,</hi> who being that day made gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the caſtle, cauſed the draw-bridge to be let down, and ſo found this to be a falſe alarum occaſioned by ſome miſtake fallen among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who continued waving up and down the ſtreets, prepoſſeſſed with ſtrange feares, and ſome of them upon ſome ſlender accident drawing their ſwords, others that knew not the cauſe thought fit to follow the example, and ſo came to appeare to this Gentleman who was none of their company, as ſo many Rebels comming up to enter the caſtle.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the firſt beginnings of our ſorrows, ill ſymptomes,<note place="margin">The Lords Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what courſe to take for the ſuppreſſing this rebellion.</note> and ſad preparatives to the enſuing evils: Therefore the Lords finding by ſeveral intelligences, though ſome purpoſely framed, that the power of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels was ſuddenly ſwollen up to ſo great a bulk, and likely ſo faſt to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and increaſe upon them, thought it high time to conſider of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and in what condition they were to oppoſe, ſince they could not prevent ſo imminent a danger. The rebellion now appeared without all manner of queſtion to be generally raiſed in all parts of the North, and like a torrent to come down moſt impetuouſly upon them: beſides, it was no wayes improbable that all other parts of the kingdome would take fire and follow their example, they had the teſtimony of <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi> poſitive therein. The firſt thing therefore which they took into conſideration, was, how they were provided of Mony, Arms, and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Then, what Companies of Foot, and Troops of Horſe of the old Army they were able to draw preſently together,<note place="margin">No money in the Exchequer.</note> as alſo what numbers of new men they could ſuddenly raiſe. For the firſt, they had this ſhort accompt from the Vice-treaſurer, That there was no mony in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. And certainly it was a main policie in the firſt contrivers of this Rebellion, to plot the breaking of it out at ſuch a time when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer ſhould be empty, and all the Kings revenues both certain and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, due for that half year, as well as the rents of all the Britiſh through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdome, ſhould be found ready either in the tenants or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors hands in the country, and ſo neceſſarily fall under their power, as they did to their great advantage. For Arms and Munition, the Stores were indifferently well furniſhed at this time: Beſides ſeverall Peeces of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114601:22"/> Artillery of divers ſorts, moſt of them fitted for preſent ſervice, there were Arms for near 10000. men, 1500 barrels of Powder, with Match and Lead proportionable, laid in by the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> late L. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, not long before, and deſigned another way, but ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely reſerved for this ſervice, as the good providence of God did exceedingly appeare therein, but principally in the miraculous preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them out of the hands of the Rebels, who made the ſurpriſall of theſe proviſions, then all within the caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> (the common ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of them) a main part of their deſigne. The old ſtanding Army, as appeares by this Liſt, conſiſted only of 41 Companies of Foot, and 14 Troops of Horſe.</p>

                     <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> the two and twentieth of this moneth, after nine of the clock at night, this bearer <hi>Owen Conally,</hi> ſervant to Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> Knight, came to me the Lord Iuſtice <hi>Parſons,</hi> to my houſe, and in great ſecreſie (as indeed the cauſe did require) diſcovered unto me a moſt wicked and damnable conſpiracy, plotted, contrived, and intended to be alſo acted by ſome evill-affected <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts here. The plot was on the then next morning, <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>23</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> being Saint <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> day, about nine of the clock to ſurprize His Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> His Majeſties chief ſtrength of this Kingdome, wherein alſo is the principall Magazine of His Majeſties Arms and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and it was agreed it ſeems amongst them, that at the ſame houre all other His Majeſties Forts and Magazines of Arms and Munition in this Kingdome, ſhould be ſurprized by others of thoſe Conſpirators, and further, that all the Proteſtants and <hi>Engliſh</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that would not joyn with them, ſhould be cut off, and ſo thoſe Papiſts ſhould then become poſſeſſed of the Government and Kingdom at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as I had that intelligence, I then immediatly repaired to the Lord Iuſtice <hi>Borlace,</hi> and thereupon We inſtantly aſſembled the Councell, and having ſate all that night, as alſo all the next day, the <hi>23</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> in regard of the ſhort time left us for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of ſo great and weighty a matter, although it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us upon ſo few houres warning to prevent thoſe other great miſchiefes which were to be acted, even at that ſame hour, and at ſo great a diſtance as in all the other parts of the Kingdome. Yet ſuch was our induſtry therein, having cauſed the Caſtle to be that night ſtrengthened with armed men, and the City guarded, as the wicked Councels of thoſe evill perſons, by the great mercy of God to us, became defeated, ſo as they were not able to Act that part of their Treachery, which indeed was principall, and which, if they could have effected, would have rendred the reſt of their purpoſes the more eaſie.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114601:23"/>
                     <p>Having ſo ſecured the Caſtle, We forthwith laid about for the apprehenſion of as many of the Offenders as We could, many of them having come to this City but that night, intending it ſeems the next morning to act their parts in thoſe treacherous and bloody crimes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt man apprehended was one <hi>Hugh Mac Mahon</hi> Eſquire (Grandſon to the Traitour <hi>Tyrone</hi> a Gentleman of a good fortune in the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> who with others, was taken that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Dublin,</hi> having at the time of their apprehenſion offered a little reſiſtance with their ſwords drawn, but finding thoſe We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt them more in number, and better armed, yielded. He upon his Examination before us at firſt denyed all, but in the end, when he ſaw we laid it home to him, he confeſſed enough to deſtroy himſelf, and impeach ſome others, as by a Copy of his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination herewith ſent, may appear to your Lordſhip, We then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him untill We might have further time to examine him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, our time being become more needfull to be imployed in action for ſecuring this place, then in examining. This <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> had been abroad, and ſerved the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as a Lieu. Colonel.</p>
                     <p>Vpon conference with him and others, and calling to minde a Letter We received the week before from Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py whereof We ſend your Lordſhip here incloſed, We gathered that the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> was to be an actor in ſurprizing the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherefore We held it neceſſary to ſecure him immediatly, thereby alſo to ſtartle and deter the reſt, when they found him laid faſt. His Lordſhip obſerving what we had done, and the City in Arms, fled from his lodging early before day, it ſeems diſguiſed, for we had laid a watch about his lodging, ſo as we think he could not paſſe without diſguiſing himſelf, yet he could not get forth of the City, ſo ſurely guarded were all the Gates.</p>
                     <p>There were found at his lodging hidden ſome Hatchets, with the Helves newly cut off cloſe to the Hatchets, and many Skeanes, and ſome Hammers.</p>
                     <p>In the end the Sheriffes of the City, whom we imployed in ſtrict ſearch of his Lordſhip, found him hidden in a Cockloft, in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114601:24"/> houſe far from his lodging, where they apprehended him, and brought him before Vs.</p>
                     <p>He denyed all, yet ſo, as he could not deny but he heard of it in the countrey, though he would not tell us when, or from whom; and confeſſed that he had not advertiſed Vs thereof, as in duty he ought to have done. But We were ſo well ſatisfied of his guiltines by all circumſtances, as We doubted not upon further examination when We could be able to ſpare time for it to finde it apparant: wherefore We held it of abſolute neceſsity to commit him Cloſe-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, as We had formerly done <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> and others: where We left him on the three and twentieth of this moneth in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about the ſame hour they intended to have been Maſters of that place, and this City.</p>
                     <p>That morning alſo We laid wait for all thoſe ſtrangers that came the night before to town, and ſo many were apprehended whom We finde reaſon to believe to have hands in this Conſpiracy, as We were forced to diſperſe them into ſeverall Gaols: and We ſince found that there came many Horſemen into the Suburbs that night, who finding the plot diſcovered, diſperſed themſelves immediately.</p>
                     <p>When the hour approached, which was deſigned for ſurpriſing the Caſtle, great numbers of ſtrangers were obſerved to come to town in great parties ſeverall wayes; who not finding admittance at the Gates, ſtaid in the Suburbs, and there grew numerous, to the terrour of the Inhabitants. We therefore to help that, drew up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and ſigned a Proclamation, commanding all men, not dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the City or Suburbs, to depart within an hour, upon pain of death, and made it alike penall to thoſe that ſhould harbour them; which Proclamation the Sheriffs immediately proclaimed in all the Suburbs by Our commandement: which being accompanied with the example and terror of the committall of thoſe two eminent men, and others, occaſioned the departure of thoſe multitudes: and in this caſe, all our lives and fortunes, and above all, his Majeſties power and regall authority being ſtill at the ſtake, We muſt vary from ordinary proceedings, not only in executing martiall law as We ſee cauſe, but alſo in putting ſome to the Rack to finde out the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114601:24"/> bottome of this treaſon, and all the contrivers thereof, which we foreſee will not otherwiſe be done.</p>
                     <p>On that <hi>23</hi> day of this moneth, We conceiving that as ſoon as it ſhould be known that the plot for ſeizing <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, all the Conſpirators in the remote parts might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſheartned, as on the other ſide the good Subjects would be comforted, and would then with the more confidence ſtand on their guard, did prepare to ſend abroad to all parts of the Kingdome this Proclamation which we ſend you here incloſed: and ſo having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the City and Castle ſhould be ſo guarded as upon the ſudden Wee could promiſe, Wee concluded that long continued conſultation.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday at <hi>12</hi> of the clock at night the Lord <hi>Blany</hi> came to town and brought Vs the ill news of the Rebels ſeiſing with two hundred men his houſe at <hi>Caſtle Blany</hi> in the County of <hi>Monagh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and his Wife, Children, and Servants, as alſo a houſe of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> called <hi>Carrickmacroſſe</hi> with two hundred men, &amp; a houſe of Sir <hi>Henry Spotſwood</hi> in the ſame County, with two hundred men; where there being a little Plantation of Brittiſh, they plundred the Town and burnt divers houſes, and it ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they burnt divers other Villages, and robbed and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler many Engliſh, and none but Proteſtants; leaving the Engliſh Papiſts untouched as well as the Iriſh.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday morning at three of the clock We had intelligence from Sir <hi>Arthur Terringham,</hi> that the Iriſh in the town had that day alſo broken up the Kings ſtore of arms and munition at the <hi>Newry,</hi> and where the ſtore of arms hath lyen ever ſince the peace, and where they found fourſcore and ten barrels of powder, and armed themſelves, and put them under the command of Sir <hi>Con. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennis</hi> Knight, and one <hi>Creely</hi> a Monk, and plundered the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh there and diſarmed the Garriſon. And this, though too much, is all that We yet hear is done by them.</p>
                     <p>However We ſhall ſtand on our guard the beſt We may to defend the Caſtle and City principally, thoſe being the pieces of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. But if the Conſpiracy be ſo univerſall as <hi>Mac Mahon</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114601:25"/> ſaith in his Examination it is, namely, That all the Counties in the Kingdome have conſpired in it, which We admire ſhould ſo fall out in this time of univerſall peace, and carried with that ſecrecy that none of the Engliſh could have any friend amongst them to diſcloſe it, then indeed We ſhall be in high extremity, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the greateſt danger that ever it underwent, conſidering our want of men, money, and armes, to enable Vs to encounter ſo great multitudes as they can make, if all ſhould joyn againſt Vs, the rather, becauſe We have pregnant cauſe to doubt that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination hath taken force by the incitement of Jeſuits, Prieſts and Fryars.</p>
                     <p>All the hope We have here, is, the old Engliſh of the Pale, and ſome other parts, will continue conſtant to the King in their fidelity, as they did in former rebellions.</p>
                     <p>And now in theſe ſtraits, We muſt under God depend on ayd forth of <hi>England</hi> for our preſent ſupply with all ſpeed, eſpecially money, We having none, and arms which we ſhall exceedingly want; without which, We are very doubtfull what account We ſhall give to the King of his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>But if the Conſpiracy be only of <hi>Mac Guire</hi> and ſome other Iriſh of the kindred and friends of the Rebell <hi>Tirone</hi> and other Iriſh in the Counties of <hi>Downe, Monaghan, Cavan, Fermanagh</hi> and <hi>Armagh,</hi> and no generall revolt following thereupon, we hope then to make head againſt them in a reaſonable meaſure if We be enabled with money from thence, without which We can raiſe no forces, ſo great is our want of money as we have formerly written, and our debt ſo great to the Army: nor is money to be borrowed here, and if it were, we would engage all our eſtates for it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we any hope to get in his Majeſties rents and ſubſidies in theſe diſturbances, which adde extreamly to our neceſsities.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday morning <hi>24.</hi> We met again in Councell, and ſent to all parts of the Kingdome the encloſed Proclamation, and iſſued Potents to draw hither ſeven Horſe troopes as a further ſtrength to this place, and to be with us in caſe the Rebels ſhall make head and march hitherward, ſo as we may be neceſsitated to give them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114601:25"/> We alſo then ſent away our Letters to the Preſident of both the Provinces of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Conaght:</hi> And we likewiſe then ſent Letters to the Sheriffes of the five Counties of the Pale to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the beſt way and means of their own preſervation. That day the Lord Vice Com. <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> the Lord Vice Co. <hi>Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> the Lord Vice Co. <hi>Fitz Williams,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Houth,</hi> and ſince the Earles of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and <hi>Fingall,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Dunſany</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> all Noblemen of the Engliſh Pale came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, declaring that they then and not before heard of the matter, and profeſſed loyalty to his Majeſty, and concurrence with the State, but ſaid they wanted armes, whereof they deſired to be ſupplyed by Vs, which we told them we would willingly do, as rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much on their faithfulneſſe to the Crown: but we were not yet certain whether or no we had enough to arme our ſtrength for the guard of the City and Caſtle; yet we ſupplyed ſuch of them as lay in moſt danger with a ſmall proportion of Arms and Munition for their houſes, leſt they ſhould conceive we apprehended any jealouſie of them. And we commanded them to be very diligent in ſending out watches, and making all the diſcoveries they could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to advertiſe us, which they readily promiſed to do.</p>
                     <p>And if it fall out that the Iriſh generally riſe, which we have cauſe to ſuſpect, then we muſt of neceſsity put Arms into the hands of the Engliſh Pale in preſent, and to others as faſt as we can, to fight for defence of the State and themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Your Lordſhip now ſees the condition wherein we ſtand, and how neceſſary it is firſt that we enjoy your preſence ſpeedily for the better guiding of thoſe and other the publick affairs of the King &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And ſecondly, that the Parliament there be moved immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to advance to Vs a good ſum of money, which being now ſpeedily ſent hither, may prevent the expence of very much treaſure &amp; blood in a long continued war. And if your Lordſhip ſhall happen to ſtay on that ſide any longer time; we muſt then deſire your Lordſhip to appoint a Lieutenant Generall to diſcharge the great and weighty burthen of commanding the forces here.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt theſe confuſions and diſcords fallen upon Vs, We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought

We deſire upon this occaſion your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to view our Letters concerning the plantation of <hi>Conaght,</hi> dated the <hi>24</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt, directed to Mr. Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> in that part thereof, which concerns the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> where now theſe fires do firſt break out.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place we muſt make known to your Lordſhip, that the Army we have, conſiſting but of <hi>2000</hi> Foot and <hi>1000</hi> Horſe, are ſo diſperſed in Garriſons in ſeverall parts, as continually they have been ſince they were ſo reduced, as if they be all ſent for to be drawn together, not only the places whence they are to be drawn, (and for whoſe ſafety they lye there) muſt be by abſence diſtreſſed; but alſo the Companies themſelves comming in ſo ſmall numbers may be in danger to be cut off in their march; nor indeed have we any money to pay the Souldiers to enable them to march. And ſo we take leave and remain from his Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dublin 25</hi> of <hi>October 1641.</hi>

               <p>The Lords now with all care and diligence applyed their further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards the preventing as much as was poſſible, the deſtruction intended againſt all the Brittiſh inhabitants of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">The Lords Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices cauſe the Proclamations to be diſperſed, Letters to be written and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to be uſed for the prevention of the riſing of the Iriſh in the North, but all to no purpoſe.</note> as well as the ſecurity of the City and the places round about it. A work of large extent, and wherein they met with many difficulties, by reaſon of their own wants both of men and money. They having formerly ſent away and diſperſed the Proclamations into ſeverall parts of the Countrey, now ſent Letters by expreſſe Meſſengers unto the Preſidents of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Conaght,</hi> and to ſeverall principall Gentlemen in thoſe two Provinces; as alſo to others within the Province of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> giving them notice of the diſcovery of the Plot, and adviſing them to ſtand upon their guard, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114601:27"/> to make the beſt proviſion they could for the defence of the Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. They ſent another expreſſe to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then at his houſe at <hi>Caricke,</hi> with Letters to the ſame effect; and withall deſired his Lordſhip preſently to repair unto them at <hi>Dublin</hi> with his Troop of horſe.

And as they gave them order for proſecution of the Rebels with fire and ſword, ſo they gave them power to receive ſuch of them in as ſhould ſubmit to his Majeſties grace and mercy. But theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches they were enforced to ſend all by ſea, the Rebels having ſtopped up the paſſages, and hindred all manner of entercourſe with that Province by land.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Severall Forts and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſuddenly ſurprized by the Rebels.</note> the Fort of <hi>Dongannon,</hi> Fort <hi>Montjoy, Carlemont, Tonrages, Caricke Mac Roſſe, Cloughouter, Caſtle Blaney, Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> being all of them pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of conſiderable ſtrength, and in ſeverall of them companies of foot, or troops of Horſe belonging to the ſtanding army. Beſides theſe they took a multitude of other Caſtles, Houſes of ſtrength, Towns, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, all abundantly peopled with Brittiſh in habitants, who had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly enriched the Countrey as well as themſelves by their painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. They had made for their more comfortable ſubſiſtance, handſome and pleaſant habitations, abounding with corn, cattell, and all other commodities that an induſtrious people could draw out of a good inland ſoile. They lived in great plenty, and ſome of them very well ſtored with plate and ready money. They lived likewiſe in as great ſecurity, being quiet and careleſſe, as the people of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> little ſuſpecting any treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from their <hi>Iriſh</hi> neighbours. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> well knew they had given them no manner of provocation; they had entertained them with great demonſtrations of love and affection. No ſtory can ever ſhew that in any Age ſince their intermixed cohabitation, they riſe up ſecretly to do them miſchief. And now of late they lived ſo peaceably and lovingly together as they had juſt reaſon moſt confidently to believe, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would never upon any occaſion generally riſe up again to their deſtruction. This I take to be one main and principall reaſon that the Engliſh were ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114601:29"/> eaſily over-run within the Northern Counties,<note place="margin">The great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Engliſh in the Iriſh, a great cauſe of their ſudden deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and ſo ſuddenly ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, before they could make any manner of reſiſtance in the very firſt begnnings of this Rebellion. For moſt of the Engliſh having either Iriſh Tenants, Servants, or Landlords, and all of them Iriſh neighbours their familiar friends: as ſoon as the fire brake out, and the whole Countrey began to riſe about them, ſome made their recourſe preſently to their Friends for protection, ſome relying upon their Neighbours, others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Landlords, others upon their Tenants and Servants for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by their Iriſh friends, ſervants, and tenants.</note> or at leaſt, preſent ſafety; and with great confidence put their lives, their Wives, their Children, and all they had, into their power. But theſe generally either betrayed them into the hands of other Rebels, or moſt perfidiouſly deſtroyed them with their own hands. The Prieſts had now charmed the Iriſh, and laid ſuch bloody impreſſions in them, as it was held, according to the maxims they had received, a mortall ſin to give any manner of relief or protection to any of the Engliſh. All bonds and tyes of faith and friendſhip were now broken; the Iriſh Landlords made a prey of their Engliſh tenants, Iriſh tenants and ſervants a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their Engliſh Landlords and Maſters, one neighbour cruelly murdered by another; the very Iriſh children in the very beginning fell to ſtrip and kill Engliſh children: all other relations were quite cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and laid aſide, and it was now eſteemed a moſt meritorious work in any of them that could by any means or wayes whatſoever, bring an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man to the ſlaughter. A work not very difficult to be compaſſed as things then ſtood.<note place="margin">The intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh among the Iriſh, a main cauſe of their ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> For they living promiſcuouſly among the Britiſh, in all parts having from their Prieſts received the Watchword both for time and place, roſe up, as it were actuated by one and the ſame ſpirit, in all places of thoſe Counties before mentioned at one and the ſame point of time; and ſo in a moment fell upon them, murdering ſome, ſtripping only, or expelling others out of their habitations. This bred ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terror and aſtoniſhment among the Engliſh as they knew not what to think, much leſſe what to do, or which way to turn themſelves. Their ſervants were killed as they were ploughing in the fields, Husbands cut to pieces in the preſence of their Wives, their Childrens brains daſhed out before their faces, others had all their goods and cattell ſeazed and carried away, their houſes burnt, their habitations laid waſte, and all as it were at an inſtant before they could ſuſpect the Iriſh for their enemies, or any wayes imagine that they had it in their hearts, or in their power, to offer ſo great violence, or do ſuch miſchief unto them.</p>
               <p>Now for ſuch of the Engliſh as ſtood upon their guard, and had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, though but in ſmall numbers, the Iriſh had recourſe to their ancient ſtratagem; which as they have formerly, ſo they ſtill continued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114601:29"/> to make frequent uſe of in this preſent Rebellion.<note place="margin">The Iriſh falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their oaths and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and after quarter given them in ſeverall places, murder and deſtroy them.</note> And that was fairly to offer unto them good conditions of quarter, to aſſure them their lives, their goods, and free paſſage, with a ſafe conduct into what place ſoever they pleaſed, and to confirme theſe covenants ſometimes under their Hands and Seals, ſometimes with deep Oaths and Proteſtations; and then as ſoon as they had them in their power, to hold themſelves diſ-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged from their promiſes, and to leave their Souldiers at liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil, ſtrip, and murder them at their pleaſure. Thus were the poor Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh treated, who had ſhut themſelves up in the great Cathedrall Church at <hi>Armagh</hi> by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> and his brother <hi>Turlogh.</hi> Thus were ſuch of the Engliſh uſed by <hi>Philip O Reley,</hi> who had retired themſelves to <hi>Belterbert,</hi> the beſt planted Town in the County of <hi>Cavan.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame barbarous manner were ſuch of the Engliſh drawn out to the ſlaughter, as had gotten into the Caſtles of <hi>Longford,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh</hi> in the County of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Newtowne</hi> in the ſame County, and ſeverall other places; as appears by ſeverall examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken upon oath, from perſons that hardly eſcaped thence with their lives. And beſides theſe other pollicies they uſed,<note place="margin">Severall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes uſed by the Iriſh to prevent the Engliſh from riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or the Scots to ioyn in their defence.</note> ſome to diſtract and diſcourage them, others to diſ-inable them to ſtand out to make any defence. As in ſeverall places the Iriſh came under divers pretences, and borrowed ſuch weapons and armes as the Engliſh had in their houſes; and no ſooner got them into their hands, but they turned them out of their own doors, as they did at <hi>Glaſlough</hi> in the County of <hi>Monaghan:</hi> And by the ſame means they very gently and fairly got into their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all the Engliſh arms in the County of <hi>Cavan:</hi> The High Sheriffe there being an Iriſhman and a Papiſt, pretending that he took their arms to ſecure them only againſt the violence of ſuch of the Iriſh as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be in arms in the next County. And that they might the more eaſily effect the deſtruction of the Engliſh, and keep off the Scots from giving them any aſſiſtance, they openly profeſſed to ſpare, as really they did at the firſt, all of the Scottiſh Nation; and pretended they would ſuffer them, as likewiſe all Engliſh Papiſts, to live quietly among them; hoping thereby to contain all of that Nation from taking up arms, till they had maſtered all the Engliſh, and that then they ſhould be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough enabled to deal with them. Thus were the poor Engliſh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the ſlaughter, and ſo exceedingly diſtracted with the tumultuous riſing of the Iriſh on all ſides about them, as they could never put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into any poſture of defence. And although in many places they made ſmall parties, and betook themſelves into ſeverall Churches and Caſtles, ſome of which were moſt gallantly long defended by them, yet did they not draw together in any ſuch conſiderable body, as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114601:30"/> them to make good their party in the field,<note place="margin">The Engliſh ſtand upon the defence of their private houſes without joyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing together in one body, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they gave great advantage to the Rebels.</note> againſt the numerous forces of the Rebels. The truth is, they did not very readily endeavour, or dexterouſly attempt it in any part of that Province, as I could hear of; every man betaking himſelf the beſt he could to the care of his own houſe, and ſeeking how to ſave his own family, his goods within, and his cattell without. And ſo while they kept ſingly apart, and ſingly ſtood up for their own private preſervation, not joyning their forces together for the common ſafety, they gave the Rebels a fair opportunity, and a ſingular advantage, to work out with great facility their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Whereas, if they had deſerted their houſes upon the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the riſing up of the Iriſh, and in the ſeverall Counties put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeverall bodies, under the commands of the chief Engliſh Gentlemen round about them, they had undoubtedly (how ill ſoever they were provided of arms and munition) been able to have encountred the Iriſh, and to have beat them out of many parts of the countrey, or at leaſt, to have put them to ſome ſtand in their enterprize. Whereas, by the courſe they took, they moſt readily, <hi>without almoſt any reſiſtance,</hi> expoſed themſelves to the mercileſſe cruelty of the Iriſh, who at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt (for ſome few dayes after their breaking out) did not in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces murder many of them: but the courſe they took, was to ſeaze upon all their goods and cattell, to ſtrip them, their wives, and children na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and in that miſerable plight, the weather being moſt bitter cold and froſty, to turn them out of their houſes, to drive them to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to wander through the Woods and Bogs; and if they by any means procured any other clothes, or but even ordinary rags to cover their nakedneſſe, they were preſently taken from them again, and none ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give them any kinde of ſhelter by the way, relief, or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without incurring the heavie diſpleaſure of their Prieſts and chief Commanders. And ſo they drove ſuch of the Engliſh, whoſe lives they thought fit at that time to ſpare, clear out of the countrey. Some of them took their journey towards <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> others towards <hi>Colraine, Derry,</hi> and other of the Northern Ports. Many who had gotten together and ſtood upon their guards, came to compoſition with their bloody aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and gave them their goods, plate and money, for leave to come up to the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi> And having bought their licenſe at ſo dear a rate, had Paſſes and Convoyes aſſigned them by the chief Captains of the Rebels, and ſo came on of their way in great Troops of Men, Women, and Children. Out of the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> as M. <hi>Creighton,</hi> (who by his charitable relief of great numbers of them, preſerved them from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) teſtifies in his examination, there paſſed by his houſe in one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny 1400 perſons, in another 500. from <hi>Newtowne</hi> in the County of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114601:30"/> 
                  <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> in others leſſer numbers, all without any weapons,<note place="margin">Adam Clovers <hi>examination.</hi>
                  </note> or any thing elſe but the very clothes on their backs, which they ſuffered them not to carry away with them; but many were moſt barbarouſly ſtripped of them, by thoſe who undertook to give them ſafe conduct, or perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly betrayed by them into the hands of other Rebels, by whom ſome were killed, others wounded: and all in a manner whatſoever they had to cover their nakedneſſe, taken from moſt of them; as may appear by the examination of <hi>Adam Clover</hi> of <hi>Slonoſy</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> who being duly ſworn, depoſeth <hi>inter alia,</hi> That this deponent and his company that were robbed, obſerved, that 30 perſons or thereabouts, were then moſt barbarouſly murdered and ſlain outright, and about 150 more perſons cruelly wounded; ſo that traces of blood iſſuing from their wounds, lay upon the High way for 12 miles together, and many very young children were left and periſhed by the way, to the number of 60 or thereabouts; becauſe the cruell purſuit of the Rebels was ſuch, that their parents and friends could not carry them further. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, that ſome of the Rebels vowed, That if any digged graves wherein to bury the dead children, they ſhould be buried therein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So the poor people left the moſt of them unburied, expoſed to ravenous beaſts and fowls, and ſome few their Parents carried a great way to bury them. And this deponent further ſaith, that he ſaw upon the way a woman left by the Rebels ſtripped to her ſmock, ſet upon by three women and ſome Iriſh children, who miſerably rent and tore the ſaid poor Engliſh woman, and ſtripped her of her ſmock in a bitter froſt and ſnow, ſo that ſhe fell in labour under their hands, and both ſhe and her childe dyed there. Thus did their mercy in ſparing thoſe miſerable ſoules in this manner prove by much a far greater cruelty then if they had ſuddenly cut them off, as they did afterwards many thouſands of Brittiſh that fell into their hands. For now they ſtarved and periſhed in multitudes upon the wayes as they travelled along; and to thoſe that outlived the miſery of their journey, their limbes only ſerved to drag up their bodies to chriſtian buriall there denied unto them. For many of the men, and moſt of the women and children that thus eſcaped, either to <hi>Dublin</hi> or other places of ſafety in the North, not long outlived the bitterneſſe of their paſſage; but either overwhelmed with grief, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied with travell, contracted thoſe diſeaſes which furthered by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, cold, nakedneſſe, ill lodgings, and want of other neceſſaries, ſtruck deeply into <hi>bodies</hi> that had lived long at eaſe with much plenty, and ſoon brought them with ſorrow to their graves.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114601:31"/>
               <p>THeſe were the firſt fruits of this Rebellion which now began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſelf into the other Provinces, having covered over the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of the Kingdome with fearfull deſolations. The firſt Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were yet undiſcovered, but the great active inſtruments appointed for the execution of this horrid deſigne fully appeared, and had already deeply imbrued their hands in the bloody maſſacres of the Engliſh. Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> being the chief of that Sept,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Phelim O Neales <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
                  </note> and now the perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of neareſt alliance to the late Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> aſſumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the chief power among the Rebels in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> and by his directions guided the reſt of his complices on, in the deſtruction of all the Engliſh there. He was one of very mean parts without courage or conduct; his education for a great part of his youth was in <hi>England;</hi> he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Student of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> and there trained up in the Proteſtant religion, which he ſoon changed after, if not before his return into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> lived looſely, and having <hi>no conſiderable eſtate,</hi> by reaſon of the great engagement upon it, became of very little eſteem in all mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Yet ſuch were the over zealous affections of his Countreymen in this cauſe, their ſecrecy in attempting, their ſuddenneſſe in executing, as by their forwardneſſe to deſtroy the Engliſh and get their goods, he quickly over-run that part of the Countrey. He had prevailed ſo far within ſeven dayes after he firſt appeared in this Rebellion, by ſeazing moſt treacherouſly at the very firſt upon <hi>Charlemont,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Caufield</hi> lay with his Foot company, the Forts of <hi>Dongannon</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> as that in his Letter written to Father <hi>Patrick O Donnell</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, bearing date from <hi>Montjoy,</hi> the 30 of Octob. he was able to brag of great and many victories. And preſently after he had gotten ſuch a multitude of <hi>rude fellowes</hi> together, though in very ill equipage, as he marched down with great numbers of men towards <hi>Liſnagaruy,</hi> near the chief Plantation of the Scots; (for that part of their plot to ſpare them, as they did in the beginning, they found now too groſſe to take, therefore they reſolved to fall upon them without mercy) and yet left ſufficient forces to come up into the Pale, to take in <hi>Dondalke</hi> in the County of <hi>Lowth.</hi> Which was a Frontier Town in the laſt wars againſt <hi>Tyrone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dondalke</hi> taken by the Rebels about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 1641.</note> and ſo well defended it ſelf, as with all the power he had, he could never recover it into his hands. There lay now a Foot company of the old Army, but the Lieutenant who commanded it, having neither his men in readineſſe, nor armes or munition, made little or no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, eaſily giving way to the forward affections of the inhabitants who delivered up the Town into the poſſeſſion of the Rebels about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of November 1641.</p>
               <p>The Rebels preſently after their taking in of <hi>Dondalke</hi> marched on

The Lord <hi>Moore</hi> had already retired thither from his houſe at <hi>Millifont,</hi> and there remained with his troop of horſe and two companies of foot. One was under the command of Sir <hi>John Nettervile,</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Nettervile.</hi> He diſcovered in the very beginning much viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in his affections, by giving falſe frights and raiſing falſe rumours, and making all manner of ill infuſions into the mindes of the Townſmen, who as it afterwards appeared, were but too forward to take part with the Rebels. It is verily believed they had in the very beginning ſome plot to cut off the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> and ſeaze upon his Troop; and that Sir <hi>John Netterviles</hi> part was to begin a mutiny, which he attempted that night he was to be upon the watch, by giving ill language, and endeavouring to make a quarrell with his Lordſhip, which he very diſcreetly paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo carefully looked to the guard of the Town, as they could take no advantage to put on their deſigne. Howſoever the Townſmen were extreamly frighted with the thoughts of their preſent danger, and the greater part of them being Papiſts, were ready to declare themſelves for the Catholick cauſe; only their deſires were, things might be ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">The ill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> repreſented by the L. <hi>Moore</hi> to the L.

The L. <hi>Moore</hi> gave preſent advertiſement unto the Lords Juſtices and Councell, of the ill condition and moſt imminent danger he found the Town to be then in, that it was not poſſible to preſerve it out of the hands of the Rebels without further ſtrength both of horſe and foot. That in caſe the enemy ſhould make any ſudden approaches, or attempt to ſurprize the Town, he found ſuch poor preparatives for defence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſuch apparant ſignes of diſloyalty in the Townſmen, and all things in ſuch a deſperate confuſion, as they ſhould not be able by the beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours they could uſe to give any good account of that place.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe particulars, together with ſeverall others, being reſolved upon the queſtion, they paſſed an Ordinance of Parliament, enabling the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raiſe 3500 foot, and 600 horſe, for the preſent ſervice there. And they further expreſſed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, not to make uſe of the aſſiſtance offered unto them by their Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> further for the preſent, then for the furniſhing them with 1000 foot, which they deſired might be tranſported out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the North of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And on the ſame day they ordered, that the Maſter of his Majeſties Ordnance ſhould deliver to the L.

               <p>Now while both Houſes of Parliament were taking Order for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men, money, and ſending proviſions and other neceſſaries for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there arrived thoſe other Letters of the 5 of November, formerly mentioned, which being addreſſed to the Lords of his Majeſties Privie Councell, were communicated to both Houſes of Parliament, and after a conference upon them, took further reſolutions for the ſpeedy ſending away ſupplyes into <hi>Ireland.</hi> And ſuch were the forward affections and zeal of the Houſe of Commons, to promove what concerned the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they thereupon voted 200000 li. to be raiſed for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Iriſh rebellion, and for ſecuring of the Kingdome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and payment of the publick debts.</p>
               <p>And that they might facilitate this great work of raiſing ſuch a ſumme of money, upon the credit of an Act of Parliament, before the money could be collected throughout the Kingdome; they thought fit, for the better encouragement of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and for the giving them full ſatisfaction in point of ſecurity for the monies formerly lent them, to make this Order following.</p>

               <p>BUt I ſhall now return to the affairs of this Kingdome, and the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſultations and means uſed here by the Juſtices and Councell for the ſecuring of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which by reaſon of the preſent confuſion, weakneſſe, and wants, were in very great, and moſt apparent danger of a ſudden ſurprize.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the Caſtle, Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby</hi> being made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, had a Company of an 100 men well armed, aſſigned for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant guard of that place, beſides the ordinary Warders, who gave their uſuall attendance there. And becauſe the Lords conceived it might be dangerous in ſuch deſperate times to admit ſuch a multitude of ſuitors of all ſorts into the Caſtle, as had daily occaſion to attend the Councell-board, they preſently transferred the place of their meeting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to <hi>Corke</hi> Houſe, where they continued to ſit a good time after, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great danger their perſons were continually expoſed unto, by the confident reſort in great numbers of ſeverall Lords, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and orhers who within few dayes after declared themſelves Rebels, and ſo went out among them. It was Gods immediate providence that preſerved them, and ſuffered not thoſe perſons, who ſoon after became ſuch bloody Rebels, to lay hold on that opportunity. For certainly, they might with great eaſe have taken out of the way the Lords Juſtices and Councell; and ſo have left all things in ſuch confuſion as would have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114601:35"/> brought on their long deſired ends without any further conteſtation or trouble.</p>
               <p>The next care was to provide victuals for the Caſtle in ſuch proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might enable it to endure a ſiege, in caſe the Town, either through treachery within, or by forces from without, ſhould come to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Rebels, who now carried all things ſo clearly before them in the North, as they moſt confidently gave it out they would ſuddenly come down and make themſelves maſters of it. How to compaſſe this, ſeemed a matter of great difficulty, in regard there was no money to be had for the performing this work ſo abſolutely neceſſary in it ſelf, and at that time ſo highly importing the ſafety &amp; preſervation, even of the whol Kingdome. Therefore the Maſter of the <hi>Rolles,</hi> upon whom the Lords were pleaſed to impoſe this ſervice of victualling the Caſtle; took the advantage of the ſtrange frights,<note place="margin">Order taken for victualling the Caſtle of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin.</hi>
                  </note> fears, and little ſafety, all the Engliſh and Proteſtants, conceived both themſelves and their goods to remain in at that time. He ſent preſently for ſome of the chief Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that were Proteſtants in the town, and clearly repreſented unto them, the high neceſſities of the State, the great danger of the town, the publick benefit, and their own private ſecurity, in laying into the Caſtle ſuch of their proviſions as they had lying by them, even in unſafe places of the City. Theſe impreſſions took, and they rightly apprehending the common danger, that they could not outlive the ruines of the Caſtle; partly out of their own good affections to the ſervice, partly out of a prudent care to ſecure their goods, were content to bring in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Beef, Herrings, and Corn upon the Maſter of the <hi>Rolles</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to ſee them ſatisfied, in caſe uſe were made of them, or otherwiſe certain reſtitution in kinde to the ſeverall owners. So as there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently laid in by the Engliſh and Dutch Merchants, within the Verge of the Caſtle, above 2000 barrels of Beef, 2000 barrels of Herrings, and a good proportion of Wheat; proviſions ſufficient, not only to victuall the Caſtle for many moneths, but which did ſerve to maintain the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my billeted in the City a long time after, and their money they received within few moneths after, by certificate from hence upon the Chamber of <hi>London;</hi> according to an Order made by both Houſes of Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> for preſent payment to be made to ſuch as laid in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the army in <hi>Ireland.</hi> There was then further Order taken to new dig and clear an old Well long ſince ſtopped up within the walls of the Caſtle; and to provide all other neceſſaries fit for a ſiege. This was the firſt ſtep to the ſafety of this place, and gave great comfort and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all the Engliſh, and Proteſtants.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:114601:35"/>
               <p>The Caſtle being thus happily provided for,<note place="margin">The Lo. Iuſtices care to provide for the ſafety of the City of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin.</hi>
                  </note> the Lords took it next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their care how to ſecure the City in ſome ſort, againſt any ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. And this proved a work not eaſie to be effected, not only in regard of the crazineſſe of the walls, the large Suburbs, and weakneſſe of the place; but much more in reſpect of the corrupt ill affections of the popiſh inhabitants within the City: So ſtrangely were many of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with the ill infuſions of their Prieſts, as they did certainly (as we found afterwards by wofull experience) do all that in them lay, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the rebellious deſignes then ſet on foot (as they believed) only for the re-ſettlement of their religion, and recovery of their liberties. They were the inſtruments to conveigh away privately moſt of the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, who would have ſurprized the Caſtle on the 23 of October. They ſecretly entertained many of the Rebels that came out of the country, they likewiſe ſent them relief that were abroad, by ſecret wayes, conveighing as wel ammunition, as intelligence of all paſſages from hence. And ſuch ſtrong averſions had they againſt all contributions for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Majeſties army; as in the very beginning of the rebellion, when the Lords ſent for the Major &amp; Aldermen, &amp; laying before them the high neceſſities of the State, together with the apparent danger of the City &amp; whole Kingdom, deſired to borrow a conſiderable ſum of money for the preſent, which they undertook to repay out of the next treaſure that ſhould arrive out of <hi>England.</hi> The popiſh party among them was ſo prevalent, as that after a moſt ſerious conſultation and very ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among themſelves, they returned this anſwer, that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to furniſh above 40 <abbr>l.</abbr> and part of that was to be brought in in cattell.</p>
               <p>There remained at this time imbarqued within the harbour of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> four hundred Iriſh ſouldiers, ready, as was pretended,<note place="margin">Severall Iriſh ſouldiers imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> at the very time of the firſt breaking out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> to ſet ſail for <hi>Spain,</hi> under the command of Colonell <hi>Iohn Barry,</hi> who with ſome other Iriſh Gentlemen had procured leave from his Majeſty to leavie certain numbers of voluntiers to be tranſported over for the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And thoſe levied in other parts, as well as at <hi>Dublin,</hi> were brought together juſt at the very time deſigned for the execution of the great plot. The pretence was ſpecious, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their intentions how finely ſoever covered over, were to have thoſe men in a readineſſe together, at the very time appointed for the firſt breaking out of theſe unnaturall troubles. And as for thoſe men which lay within the Harbour of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they were ſo great a terrour to all the Proteſtant inhabitants in the City, as it exceedingly perplexed the Lords how to diſpoſe ſo of them as might prevent the miſchief juſtly feared, in caſe of their landing. Their Commanders had ſo handſomely
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114601:36"/> ordered the matter, as though they were deſigned for a long voyage, yet ſtay on ſhip-board any longer they could not, by reaſon they had no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, not even enough to carry them out of the Harbour; and no man had order in the abſence of Colonell <hi>Barry</hi> (who retired himſelf ſome few miles out of the town, the very evening before the Caſtle ſhould have been taken) to provide for the further ſupplying of them. To ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to land, was to adde ſo many inſtruments of miſchief to thoſe already gathered within and about the City. Therefore it was reſolved that the Captain of the Kings Pinace then in the Harbour ſhould by force keep them from landing, which he did ſeverall dayes together, till it was apparent they would inevitably ſtarve, if a courſe were not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken to afford them ſome relief. Whereupon the Lords having no means to victuall them aboard, gave them leave to land, having firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken order they ſhould not come into the City.</p>
               <p>The Lords Juſtices and Councell thought fit within very few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the landing of theſe men, the more to deter them, and all other ill-affected perſons from repairing to the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Several Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations iſſued out by the Lo. Iuſtices and Councell.</note> to iſſue out a Proclamation for the diſcovery and preſent removall of all ſuch as did or ſhould come and continue there without juſt or neceſſary cauſe. But ſo carefull were they in this, and all other their actions, not to give any diſtaſte to the Iriſh or other inhabitants of the countrey, as they forbear to inflict any puniſhment upon any that continued in the City contrary to their Proclamation, ſparing ſeverall perſons whom they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt cauſe to be jealous off, but who were brought before them, and convinced to have uttered ſpeeches clearly diſcovering their ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And having by late Proclamations prorogued the Parliament, and adjourned <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, that under pretence of repair to either of them, unneceſſary concourſe of ſtrangers might not be brought unto the town, they proceeded on to ſome other Acts, which as they conceived would not only render great ſecurity to the City, but leſſen the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers abroad, bring ſafety to the <hi>Pale,</hi> and keep the dangers at diſtance, and far off from them. And for this purpoſe they being informed, that a multitude of the meaner ſort of people were ignorantly involved in the guilt of this rebellion, and by the wicked ſeducement of the firſt Conſpirators had been drawn on to diſpoile their Engliſh neighbours, they iſſued out a Proclamation about the beginning of the moneth of November, declaring unto all ſuch as were not Freeholders within the County of <hi>Meath, Weſtmeath, Lowth,</hi> and <hi>Longford;</hi> that if they would come in and ſubmit, make reſtitution of the goods ſo taken, they ſhould be received to his Majeſties mercy, and no further proſecution held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114601:36"/>
               <p>Much about the time of the ſending forth of this Proclamation, ſome of the chief of the Sept of the <hi>Relyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Remonſtrance ſent up to the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, from the Rebels in the county of <hi>Cavan.</hi>
                  </note> and other prime Gentlemen in the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> ſent up a kinde of Remonſtrance to the Lords Juſtices and Councell. Whereunto they returned them a very fair anſwer, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them of their readineſſe to give them all juſt redreſſe of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances expreſſed therein, ſo they would in the mean time retire peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to their houſes, reſtore as they were able the Engliſh mens goods, &amp; forbear all further acts of rapine and violence. And they did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend over their Remonſtrance to the Lord Lieutenant, to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Majeſtie, according to their deſires. But theſe wayes of moderation and peaceable perſwaſions, proved of very little effect, they had no manner of influence into the reſolved mindes of the Leaders, or of operation upon the hardned hearts of the people; they were too deeply engaged, ſo ſleightly to retire. They had now drenched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the blood of the Engliſh, and were greatly enriched with their ſpoiles. It was not poſſible for them to make reſtitution, and they hoped to go through with the work, and by the united power of the Kingdome to draw the whole management of the affairs into their own hands.</p>
               <p>And now likewiiſe the Lords Juſtices and Councell, that they might ſhew the great confidence they had in the Lords and chief Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commiſſions of martiall law granted unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons by the Lords Iuſtices.</note> and give them both oportunity and means to expreſſe their loyalty and affections to his Majeſties ſervice, reſolved (according as the conſtitution of their affairs then required) to do ſome ſuch acts as might clearly perſwade them of the great truſt they really repoſed in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore firſt they gave out ſeverall Commiſſions of Martiall law, for executing (without attending a proceeding according to the ordinary courſe of the Common law) of ſuch Traitors and Rebels as ſhould be apprehended doing miſchief in any parts of the countrey about them. And theſe they directed to the moſt active Gentlemen, though all Papiſts, inhabiting in the ſeverall Counties, As, to <hi>Henry Talbot</hi> in the County of <hi>Dublin, John Bellew</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the county of <hi>Lowth, Richard Dalton</hi> and <hi>Iames Tuit</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Next they made choice of the chief perſons of quality reſiding in the ſaid Counties of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and others adjacent to them, to govern and command ſuch forces as ſhould be raiſed by them, and armed by the ſtate for the defence of the Countrey, and iſſued out from the Councel-board ſeverall Commiſſions of government unto them.

               <p>IN theſe Commiſſions it is very obſervable, that there was power given to theſe Lords and Gentlemen to whom they were directed, not only to uſe fire and ſword, for the deſtruction of the Rebels and their adherents, but alſo to preſerve the lives of any of them, to receive them or any of them, into his Majeſties favour or mercy. This plainly ſhewes the very great confidence the Lords were pleaſed to repoſe in them; as alſo their deſires to make them inſtruments, to deliver thoſe multitudes of people that engaged themſelves in this rebellion, from the power, either of his Majeſties arms, or civill juſtice, They intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the reducing of a rebellious Nation; and they at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed lenitives, which failing in the cure, they were afterwards then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to have recourſe to more violent medicines.</p>

It had already infected the counties of <hi>Letrim, Longford, Weſt-Meath,</hi> and <hi>Lowth,</hi> lying contiguous unto them. And upon the 12 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the Iriſh in the County of <hi>Wiclow</hi> brake out moſt furiouſly, deſpoiling, robbing, and murthering all the Engliſh inhabitants within that territory. They burnt all their fair well-built houſes, drove away their cattell, and laid ſiege to Fort <hi>Carew,</hi> wherein was a foot company of the old army. The newes being brought to the Lords Juſtices thereof, they well conſidered the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the place, and that if it were in the hands of the Rebels, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114601:39"/> that whole county in their poſſeſſion, they could expect little quietneſſe, or even ſafety in the Citie, by reaſon of their near neighbourhood. Whereupon they were moſt deſirous to have ſent down forces for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it. But when they came on the other ſide to conſider their want of means for the performance of that ſervice, that they had no money, but few men, and many of them not to be truſted. That it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous to divide their ſmall forces, and ſo to leave the Citie in a manner unguarded, they were enforced to lay aſide that reſolution, and with great grief to ſit ſtill and ſuffer the poor Engliſh in thoſe parts to be expoſed to the mercileſſe cruelties of thoſe barbarous Rebels who went on furiouſly with the work, and quickly cleared all that county of the Engliſh inhabitants. Within few dayes after, the Iriſh in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Caterlagh</hi> began to riſe likewiſe, and to follow the bloody examples of their neighbours. There were now alſo great appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies of the diſloyalty of the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> who with large prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations under the pretence of doing ſervice had gotten into their hands the arms and munition deſigned for them by the State. And ſo myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and doubtfull was the carriage of the Lords and chief Gentlemen of the Engliſh <hi>Pale,</hi> giving no manner of intelligence to the State of the proceedings of the Rebels, nor making any kinde of preparatives againſt them, as their affections began even then to be juſtly ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>So as the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> being the receptacle of the whole State,<note place="margin">The ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </note> the Magazine of all the arms, munition and other proviſions for the army, and the chief ſanctuary of all the Engliſh and deſpoiled Proteſtants, was now reduced to a very ſad condition, deſperately encompaſſed on every ſide, the Northern Rebels being come down in two ſeverall parties with great forces, within 20 miles of it on the one ſide, and the Rebels of the County of <hi>VViclow</hi> infeſting it on the other ſide: which with the great reſort of ſtrangers, and the continuall rumours of new plots and devices to ſurprize the town, poſſeſſed the Proteſtants with extraordinary fears of their preſent danger. But that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> made their condition appear much more formidable unto them, was the daily repair of multitudes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> that came up in troops, ſtripped, and miſerably deſpoiled, out of the North. Many perſons of good rank and quality, covered over with old rags, and ſome without any other covering then a little twiſted ſtraw to hide their nakedneſſe. Some reverend Miniſters and others that had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with their lives, ſorely wounded. Wives came bitterly lamenting the murders of their Husbands, mothers of their children barbarouſly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before their faces, poor infants ready to periſh &amp; poure out their ſouls in their mothers boſome: ſome over-wearied with long travell, and ſo ſurbated, as they came creeping on their knees; others frozen up with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114601:40"/> cold,<note place="margin">The reſort of multitudes of men, women and children to the City of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi> in a moſt miſerable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</note> ready to give up the ghoſt in the ſtreets: others overwhelmed with grief, diſtracted with their loſſes, loſt alſo their ſenſes. Thus was the town within the compaſſe of a few dayes after the breaking out of this rebellion filled with theſe moſt lamentable ſpectacles of ſorrow, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wandred up and down in all parts of the City, deſolate, forſaken, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no place to lay their heads on, no clothing to cover their nakedneſſe, no food to fill their hungry bellies. And to adde to their miſeries, they found all manner of relief very diſproportionable to their wants, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh inhabitants refuſing to miniſter the leaſt comfort unto them: ſo as thoſe ſad creatures appeared like living ghoſts in every ſtreet. Many emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houſes in the city, were by ſpeciall direction taken up for them: Barns, Stables, and out-houſes, filled with them, yet many lay in the open ſtreets, and others under ſtals &amp; there moſt miſerably periſhed. The Churches were the common receptacles of the meaner ſort of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſtood there in a moſt dolefull poſture, as objects of charity, in ſo great multitudes, as there was ſcarce any paſſage into them. But thoſe of better quality, who could not frame themſelves to be common beggars, crept into private places; &amp; ſome of them that had not private friends to relieve them, even waſted ſilently away, and ſo died without noiſe. And ſo bitter was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former condition, and ſo inſupportable the burthen of their preſent calamity to many of them, as they even refuſed to be comforted. I have known of ſome that lay almoſt naked, &amp; having clothes ſent, laid them by, refuſing to put them on. Others that would not ſtir to fetch themſelves food, though they knew where it ſtood ready for them. But they continued to lie naſtily in their filthy rags, and even their own dung, not taking care to have any thing clean, handſome or comfortable about them. And ſo even worn out with the miſery of their journey and cruell uſage, having their ſpirits ſpent, their bodies waſted, and their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes failing, lay here pitifully languiſhing; and ſoon after they had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this town, very many of them dyed, leaving their bodies as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt inhumane cruelties uſed towards them. The greateſt part of the women and children thus barbarouſly expelled out of their habitations, periſhed in the city of <hi>Dublin:</hi> and ſo great numbers of them were brought to their graves, as all the Churchyards within the <hi>whole Town</hi> were of too narrow a compaſſe to contain them. So as the Lords took order to have two large pieces of new ground, one on each ſide the River, taken in upon the out-Greens, and ſet apart for burying places. Theſe were the memorable ſpectacles of mercy, and of the great commiſeration the Rebels uſed to thoſe Engliſh, to whom they gave their lives for a prey. But what their ſufferings were, before they could get out of the hands of thoſe bloody Villaines, what ſtrange horrid
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114601:40"/> inventions they uſed towards them, torturing and maſſacring thoſe they there murthered, is reſerved to be more fully related in its proper place. They are left upon record to poſterity, under the oathes of many that eſcaped, &amp; mentioned here to no other purpoſe, then to ſhew the ſtrange horror and amazement the beholding of them bred in all the Engliſh and Proteſtant inhabitants of the City. They ſeeing the Rebels prevaile ſo mightily, expected if they continued here to be undoubtedly expoſed to the ſame cruelties. And they now underſtood by thoſe who were come up from among them, that their deſigne was; As ſoon as they had taken in <hi>Tredagh,</hi> to come and ſeaze upon the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo to make a generall extirpation of all the Engliſh, root and branch; not to leave them name or poſterity throughout the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to conjecture what a ſad confuſed countenance the City then had: what fears, terror, and aſtoniſhment, the miſerable ſpectacles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the approaches of the Rebels without, raiſed in the mindes of an affrighted, diſtracted people. The Engliſh inhabitants looked upon all the horrid cruelties exerciſed abroad, all the calamities and deſolations fallen upon their countreymen in other parts of the Kingdome, as arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at theſe gates, and now ready to enter: the Avenues all open,<note place="margin">The fears and diſtractions within the City of <hi>Dublin.</hi>

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the carefull travels and endeavours uſed by the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Councell to make proviſion for the common ſafety, no money could be raiſed, few men gotten together: the Papiſts well furniſhed with arms cloſely concealed, and deſperately animated by their Prieſts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> down in the very height of theſe diſtractions. And ſo careleſſe were the Citizens, and ſo ſlowly went they about the making up that breach, and under pretence of want of money, they let it lye open till the Lords ſent unto them 40 li. toward the reparation. All things tended to a ſudden confuſion; the very face of the City was now changed, and had ſuch ghaſtly aſpect, as ſeemed to portend her near approaching ruine: the means of ſafety appearing very ſlender and inconſiderable: the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by reaſon of the ſtrange <hi>averſions</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh party</hi> of a very ſlow and weak operation. Every man began to conſider himſelf and his own private preſervation. Thoſe that lived in the Suburbs removed, with their families into the City. The Privie Councellours and perſons of quality into the Caſtle, which became a common repoſitory of all things of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. The Rolles were by ſpeciall order removed thither: the Records of ſeverall other Offices were likewiſe brought in. But upon the Rebels advance ſomewhat nearer, and their frequent alarms, many of thoſe who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114601:41"/> had there taken ſanctuary, began to ſuſpect the ſtrength of thoſe old crazy walls, and therefore to make ſure, reſolved to quit the Kingdome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing themſelves and their goods with all poſſible ſpeed. Some who were detained with contrary winds in the Harbour choſe rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all extremities on ſhipboard, then to hazard themſelves aſhoar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Scotiſh Fiſhermen, who lay with their Boats in great numbers within the Bay, fiſhing for Herrings, having with much forwardneſſe made an offer to the State to bring 500 of their men aſhoar to be put in arms and do preſent ſervice (a propoſition at that ſeaſon moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) were ſo ſtrangely affrighted one evening with a falſe alarm, as that in the night, on a ſudden, they put to ſea, and quite diſappeared on theſe Coaſts till the year following. The Papiſts on the other ſide being moſt confident that the City would be taken and ſack'd by the Rebels, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, leſt happily they might be miſtaken in the tumult and fierce execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, removed themſelves and their goods with the ſame ſpeed into the countrey. And that which heightned the calamity of the poor Engliſh was their flight in the Winter, in ſuch a diſmall ſtormy, tempeſtuous ſeaſon, as in the memory of man had never been obſerved formerly to continue ſo long together. Yet the terror of the Rebels incomparably prevailing beyond the rage of the ſea; moſt of thoſe who could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves of ſhipping, though at never ſo exceſſive rates, deſerted the City: and ſuch was the violence of the windes, ſuch continuing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſtorms, as ſeverall Barques were caſt away, ſome in three moneths after their going from hence could recover no Port in <hi>England:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that then put to ſea, were in great danger of periſhing. The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the Engliſh Nation, which were very great in this Kingdome, were now full: Heaven and Earth ſeemed to conſpire together for the puniſhment of them. God certainly declared his high indignation againſt them for their great ſins wherewith they had long continued to provoke him in this land, and ſuffered theſe barbarous Rebels to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of miſchief and cruell executioners of his fierce wrath upon them. <hi>But becauſe they have taken vengeance with a deſpightfull heart to deſtroy them,</hi>

But before I paſſe further, or come to declare the univerſal dilatation of it throughout the whole Kingdom, and how it pleaſed God even miraculouſly to bleſſe the painfull endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the State, in the preſervation of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> till the arrivall of their long expected ſuccours out of <hi>England:</hi> I hold it not amiſſe to look back, and (as far as the late diſcoveries and dark glimmerings we have into the firſt plot will admit) to trace it up to the firſt beginnings we find of it within this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt Originall of this great Conſpiracy, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the firſt plotters and contrivers of it, I muſt ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that I am my ſelf much unſatisfied in the firſt conceptions of this monſtrous birth,<note place="margin">Who were the plotters of it not yet cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered.</note> and therefore ſhall not not now be able cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſolve others therein: I cannot yet determine who were the very firſt Contrivers, where the firſt debates were entertained, or who firſt ſate in Counſell about it. This, as all other works of this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114601:42"/> nature, had its foundation laid in the dark, and ſealed up no doubt with many execrable Oaths, the great engines of theſe times, to bind up the conſciences as well as the tongues of men from diſcovery: Beſides, they knew well enough, that the Plot being moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf, to be carried on with ſuch deteſtable cruelty, ſhould it take and be fully executed (which commonly gives to all other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons applauſe and higheſt commendation) would certainly render the firſt authors, as well as the bloody actors, moſt odious and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable to all Poſterity: Therefore it is not much to be wondred, that the firſt beginnings ſo myſterious and obſcurely laid, remain as yet concealed with ſo great <hi>Obstinacy:</hi> But yet I am very confident, that upon view of ſeverall examinations, any reaſonable man will conclude with me, that the very firſt principles of this inhumane Conſpiracy, were roughly drawn and hammered out at the Romiſh Forge, powerfully fomented by the trechery and virulent animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſome of the chief <hi>Iriſh</hi> natives, and ſo by degrees, by them moulded into that ugly ſhape wherein it firſt appeared: There cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it received the firſt life and motion, whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in any other place, I cannot yet determine; But my meaning is, it was firſt hatched and ſet on foot by thoſe moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and induſtrious Emiſſaries, who are ſent continually abroad by the power of that See with full commiſſion, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to make way for the re-eſtabliſhment of the Romiſh Religion in all parts where it hath been ſuppreſſed. Great numbers of theſe wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments (the Laws againſt all of the Romiſh Clergy, being of late laid aſide, and tacitely ſuſpended execution) came over into <hi>Ireland:</hi> The main ground-work, and firſt prediſpoſitions to a Rebellion in generall, were moſt undoubtedly with great dexterity and artifice laid by them; their venimous infuſions taking ſuch deep roots in the minds of a blind, ignorant, ſuperſticious people, as made them ready for a change, the great ones miſchievouſly to plot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, the inferiour ſort tumultuouſly to riſe up and execute whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould command.</p>
            <p>And if we will give credit to ſeverall examinations taken, many of them from thoſe of their own, we muſt beleeve the plot for a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The general Plot for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient date.</note> of a very ancient date, as well as of a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: It had been long in contriving, and howſoever, peradventure firſt thought on in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet received large contributions towards conſummation out of <hi>England</hi> and other Forraign parts.</p>

Roger Moore,</hi> one of the prime Conſpirators, told Maſter <hi>Colely,</hi> then priſoner with him, that the Plot had been in framing ſeverall yeers, and ſhould have been executed ſeverall times, but they were ſtill hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. By Letters ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> which were intercepted and brought to the Lord <hi>Parſons,</hi> though the Fryar that writ them doth not expreſſe any certain knowledge of this very Plot, yet thus much appears by them, that they had long deſired to hear of the riſing of the Iriſh, that the news
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114601:43"/> of Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal's</hi> taking arms was very acceptable to the Pope and his two Cardinal Nephews, aſſuring him of all aſſiſtance from thence, and further deſiring him to ſend over an Agent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to imploy ſeveral perſons of his own Nation, whom he there named, then reſiding at <hi>Madrid, Paris,</hi> and with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> they being fit Inſtruments, and ſuch as he might make uſe of for the procuring ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from thoſe Princes, whom he aſſured him would joyn to give him all aſſiſtance in this action.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, we have very many other preſumptions that the Iriſh ſince they found their own ſtrength,<note place="margin">The Iriſh have had it long in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſhake off the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and that they were able to draw together ſo great numbers of men, as their ſeverall Septs ſo ſtrangely multiplied during the late peace can now afford, have long had it in deſign to ſhake off the Engliſh government, to ſettle the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the State in the hands of the Natives, and to re-poſſeſſe them of all the Lands now enjoyed by the Britiſh throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And that in this plot they did but goe about to actuate thoſe confuſed general notions, &amp; to put them in a way of execution. Now they ſuppoſed there could never be offered unto them a fairer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity then this moſt unhappy conjuncture of the affairs of great Brittain, when <hi>Scotland</hi> lately in Arms, had by their own power and wiſe managements, drawn his Majeſty to condiſcend to their entire ſatisfaction, as wel in their Church diſcipline, as the liberties of that Kingdom. And in <hi>England,</hi> the diſtractions being grown up to ſome height, through the great miſunderſtanding betwixt the King and his Parliament, <hi>Ireland</hi> was at this time left naked and unregarded, the Government in the hands of Juſtices, the old Army diſperſed in places of ſo great diſtance, as it could be of little advantage, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers moſt of them <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and all the old Commanders and Captains, except ſome few worn out and gone: This, as the firſt plotters thought, was the time to work out their own ends, and masking their perfidious deſigns under the publike pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the defence of his Majeſties Prerogative, they let looſe the reins of their own vindicative humour and irreconcilable hatred to their Britiſh Neighbours.</p>
            <p>I will not preſume to ſay, they knew what would fall out in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or what miſerable embroilments that Kingdom was ready to break out into; for undoubtedly the firſt plot was laid, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>actly formed many moneths before the war brake out betwixt the King and his people. But thus much I ſhall be bold to affirm, that upon the very firſt breaking out of this Rebellion, they did ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjecture, and beyond all appearance of reaſon, even ſomewhat
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114601:43"/> poſitively divine, of the diſmal breach and fearfull diſtempers which afterwards followed to the diſabling of the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> from applying remedies towards the reducement of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For the atteſtation of this truth, I could produce the generall concurrence of ſeverall circumſtances, many private diſcourſes and advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as alſo a particular Letter which I had long by me, written as it ſeems, from a very intelligent Papiſt, a great Zealot in the cauſe, unto a Nephew of Sir <hi>Toby Matthew's,</hi> then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who, though lately converted, retained yet a great friendſhip among them. He tels him in the beginning of the Letter, that he was deſired from ſome well wiſhing friends, to adviſe him, as he tendered his ſafety and ſecurity, upon the ſight of thoſe inſtantly to forſake and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that troubleſom and moſt unfortunate Kingdom, for God and man had ſpeedily reſolved to afflict and puniſh the overgrown im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of theſe prophane times, all hearts and hands happily conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to it; and that he ſhould be as ſpeedy in his paſſage as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and rather, as the caſe ſtood, hazard all dangers by ſea, then the leaſt at land, to be ſure not to ſtop in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that ſink of ſin (as he cals it) and center of diſorders, for by that time he arrived there, he ſhould be ſure to find nothing but troubles, factions and deſperate diſtempers; that he ſhould diſpatch therefore for <hi>Paris,</hi> or rather <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where there ſhould be order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the removall of all miſtakes betwixt him and his Uncle. This Letter was written about the beginning of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1641. which was ſome few dayes after the breaking out of this Rebellion, and full ſix moneths before the taking up of Arms in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>Now for the very time when this great Plot received its firſt forme,<note place="margin">The Plot for a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> firſt diſcovered to the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, about the time of Maſter <hi>John Bellewes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>England,</hi> with commiſſion to continue the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1640.</note> though I conceive it of ſomewhat a more ancient date, yet by all the examinations I have hitherto ſeen, I can carry it up no higher then the moneth of <hi>January</hi> 1640. and that it was about that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to ſome of the chief Gentlemen of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> doth ſufficiently teſtifie as well in the relation written with his own hand in the Tower, and delivered by him to Sir <hi>John Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> then Lieutenant, to be preſented to the Lords in Parliament, as alſo in his Examination taken before the Lord <hi>Lambart</hi> and Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Meredith</hi> Kinght, in <hi>Ireland, March</hi> 26. 1642. In both theſe he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that he being in <hi>Dublin</hi> in Candlemas Tearm, about the time when Maſter <hi>John Bellew</hi> came out of <hi>England</hi> with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the continuance of the Parliament in <hi>Ireland; Roger Moore</hi> acquainted him, that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would riſe, they might make their own conditions for the regaining of their Lands, and Freedome of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114601:44"/> their Religion; and further ſaith, that he had ſpoken with ſundry of <hi>Lemster</hi> to that purpoſe, who would be ready to joyn with them, as likewiſe a good part of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and that he found all of them willing thereto, if ſo be they could draw to them the Gentlemen of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the manner of putting this Plot in execution, the ſaid Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> doth further teſtifie in his relation aforeſaid, that the ſaid <hi>Roger Moore</hi> having the next day acquainted <hi>Philip O Rely, Turlagh O Neale,</hi> Brother to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> Maſter <hi>Coſloe,</hi> and <hi>Mac Mahone</hi> herewith, did propoſe, that firſt every one ſhould endeavour to draw his own friends into that act, at leaſt thoſe that did live in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with them, and that when they had ſo done, they ſhould ſend to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> to let them know of the day and reſolution, ſo that they might be over with them by that day, or ſoon after with ſupply of Arms and Munition, that there ſhould be a ſet day appointed, and every one in his own Quarters ſhould riſe out that day and ſeize upon all the Arms he could get in his own County, and this day to be neer Winter, ſo that <hi>England</hi> could not be able to ſend Forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> before <hi>May,</hi> and by that time there was no doubt to be made, but that they themſelves would be ſupplied by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from beyond the Seas. Then he told them further, that there was no doubt to be made of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> joyning with them, and that all the doubt was in the Gentlemen of the Pale; but he ſaid, for his own part, he was really aſſured, that when they had riſen out, the <hi>Pale</hi> Gentlemen would not ſtay long after, at leſt they would not oppoſe any thing; and that in caſe they did, that they had men enough in the Kingdom without them: Moreover, that he had ſpoken to a great man (who then ſhould be nameleſſe) who would not fail at the day appointed, to appear and to be ſeen in the act, but that till then he was ſworn not to reveal him, but yet that upon their importunity, he afterwards told them, it was the Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> who was very powerfull in the command of men in thoſe parts of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> where he lived: He further ſaith, that in Lent following, Maſter <hi>Moore,</hi> according to his promiſe, came into <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> but that nothing was done there, but all matters put off till <hi>May</hi> following, where they met at <hi>Dublin,</hi> it being both Parliament and Tearm time, and that from thence they diſpatched one <hi>Tooly Conley,</hi> pariſh Prieſt to Maſter <hi>Moore,</hi> to Colonel <hi>O Neale,</hi> in the Low-Countries, who within few moneths after arrived with this anſwer from the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, deſiring them not to delay any time in riſing out, but to let him know of the day when they intended it, and that he would not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114601:44"/> faile to be with them within fourteen dayes of that day, with good ayd; alſo deſiring them by any means to ſeize on the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> if they could. And further he ſaith, that during the time of theſe their private meetings, there landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> Colonel <hi>Birne,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Plunket,</hi> Captain <hi>Brien O Neale,</hi> and others, who came with dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to carry men away, and that theſe were acquainted with the Plot, and did offer their ſervice to bring it on, and that they would raiſe their men under colour to carry them into <hi>Spain,</hi> and then ſeize on the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with the arms found there, arme their Souldiers, and have them ready for any action that ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. He further alſo ſaith, that they had divers private conſultations about the carrying on of this conſpiracy, not onely at <hi>Dublin,</hi> but in ſeverall other places in the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> and that they had ſet down ſeverall days for the putting of it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but meeting with ſome obſtacles, did not come to conclude of the certain time till about the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and that then they peremptorily reſolved on the 23. of <hi>October</hi> for the day to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this long deſigned plot in; and that they had reſpect unto the day of the week, which did fall on Saturday, being the Market-day, on which there would be the leſſe notice taken of people up and down the ſtreets; that they then ſetled what numbers of men ſhould be brought up out of the ſeverall Provinces for the ſurprize of the Caſtle, and what Commanders ſhould lead them on, that ſeeing the Caſtle had two Gates, that the <hi>Lemster</hi> men ſhould undertake to ſeize upon the little Gate, which lay neereſt to the place where the arms and munition was placed; and that the great gate ſhould be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thoſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> ſhould be there in perſon; but that he excuſed himſelf, becauſe he reſolved at the ſame time to ſeize upon <hi>London Derry,</hi> and that thereupon by the impottu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the undertakers, it was impoſed upon him the ſaid Lord <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> to be there in perſon at the taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> That it was further reſolved what number of Forces ſhould be brought up out of the other Provinces, to make good thoſe places if poſſeſſed by them, and that Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> did undertake to be there with 1000. men within four dayes after the taking of the Caſtle; as alſo that it was reſolved that every one privy to that matter in every part of the Kingdome, ſhould riſe out that day and ſeize on all the Forts and Arms in the ſeverall Counties; as likewiſe on all the Gentry, and make them priſoners, the more to aſſure themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any adverſe fortune, and not to kill any but where of neceſſity they ſhould be forced thereunto by oppoſition. Theſe particulars,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114601:45"/> together with many other circumſtances very conſiderable, are ſet down in the relation given in by the Lord <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> while he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned priſoner in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> but I have thought fit to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to relate them at large, becauſe I find that relation publiſhed by authority, and ſo preſented to the common view. We ſhall find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that <hi>Mac Mahone</hi> in his examination taken when he was firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Lords Juſtices and Counſel here, doth teſtifie that all the chief of the Nobility and Gentry in this Kingdom were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the firſt plot, and particularly, that all the popiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Committee ſent into <hi>England,</hi> as likewiſe in both houſes of Parliament knew of it: In the Examnation of <hi>William Fitz Gerald,</hi> it is there affirmed, that Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> ſending for him five days after his riſing in Arms, told him, what he did was by directions and conſent of the prime Nobility and Gentry of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that what he had done in the Northern parts, the ſame was executed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in all other Forts and Towns through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Ireland:</hi> As being a courſe reſolved upon among the Lords and Gentry, for the preſervation <hi>of his Majesties Prerogative,</hi> their own Religion and Liberties, againſt the Puritan faction in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the Lord of <hi>Gormanſtone</hi> knew of this plot while he was in <hi>England,</hi> is teſtified by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Read</hi> in his Examination, as alſo by the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> in his relation; who ſaith, that Colonel <hi>Plunket</hi> told him, that he being at <hi>London,</hi> had acquainted ſome of the Iriſh Committee, and particularly the Lord of <hi>Gormanstone,</hi> with this plot, and that they approved it well: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Plunket</hi> in his Letter to Father <hi>Patrick Barnwal,</hi> Lord Abbot of <hi>Mellifont</hi> (as he ſtiles him) doth ſeem much to glory in the means he had uſed to incite the Lords and Gentry of the Pale to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that bleſſed cauſe (as he tearms it) and aſſures him that the Lord of <hi>Gormanstone,</hi> whom he there cals Lord General, will goe bravely on.</p>
            <p>And now it will be no difficult matter to reſolve what were the ſecondary ſteps and motions of this great plot, as well as by what perſons it was wrought out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and carried on to the very point of execution. And firſt it is to be obſerved, that howſoever Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mac Guire, Philip O Rely,</hi> Colonel <hi>Mac Brian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of the Rebellion did not firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in it</note> 
               <hi>Hugh Mac Mahone,</hi> and their adherents, chief of the Iriſh Septs in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> and other counties neer adjacent, did firſt appeare upon the ſtage, and by their bloody execution notoriouſly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chief actors in this horrid tragedy: Yet this Rebellion was either altogether nor originally plotted by them, moſt of them had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114601:45"/> but ſubordinate notions of it, and they as other of the chief Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry throughout the Kingdom, had ſeverall parts aſſigned them to act at ſeverall times in ſeverall places, and did but move ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt reſolutions taken, and ſuch directions as they had received from the firſt Conſpirators: I take it to be moſt probable, after the generall plot came to be reduced into form, that as the Lord of <hi>Gormanstone</hi> was one of the firſt and chief movers in it, ſo he and the chief of the <hi>Pale</hi> joyned together to draw in (as they had done in all former Rebellions) the principall ſepts of the old <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to engage themſelves, and to appear firſt in the buſineſſe:<note place="margin">That the Lord of <hi>Gormanston</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Engl. Pale were engaged in the firſt Plot is very probable.</note> And after they had joyned together, and ſo finely ordered the matter, as they had made it a generall riſing, as Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> tearms it, of all the Catholicks throughout the Kingdom, with the generall conſent of the prime Nobility and Gentry thereof; then, as it were, with one generall voice, they ſounded forth from all the four Provinces of <hi>Ireland</hi> the ſame language, they uſed the ſame Remonſtrances, and made the very ſame pretences for their juſtification, they began the very ſelf-ſame courſe, firſt in ſtripping, then baniſhing and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Britiſh and Proteſtants, onely in the North, they drove on ſomewhat more furiouſly, and ſpilt much more innocent blood, then in any of the other three Provinces: They agreed likewiſe in recalling their Commanders, all the four Provinces had their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Emiſſaries abroad: Thoſe of <hi>Lemster</hi> brought back Colonel <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> a Branch out of the Houſe of <hi>Gormanstone,</hi> who had long lived with good reputation in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and him they made Generall of their Forces there; but of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster</hi> they ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> likewiſe for <hi>Owen Roe O Neale,</hi> upon whom they conferred the ſame charge in that Province: The <hi>Munſter</hi> men brought over <hi>Garrat Barry,</hi> whom they made Generall of their forces: And thoſe in <hi>Conaught</hi> drew back one of the <hi>Burks,</hi> to whom they gave the chief command of ſuch men as they were able to draw together for the advancement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſign: All theſe held a due correſpondency, and in all their actions had a juſt concurrency towards the main end.</p>
            <p>The great inſtrument chiefly imployed in this work of drawing the meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> into a firm combination with the old Engliſh (as appears by the Lord <hi>Mac Guire's</hi> relation before mentioned) was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Moore</hi> Eſquire, a perſon of a broken fortune,<note place="margin">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114601:46"/> engagements, and more then I can well imagine, it had not been poſſible that ſo many perſons of quality, having great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and many children, ſhould have declared themſelves, after they ſaw the main part of the plot for the ſurprize of the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> to fail, and the power of the Northern Rebels begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had with great alacrity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe undertaken the War, and not only engaged themſelves to his Majeſty to ſend over powerfull ſupplies both out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but by their publike Order of both Houſes, ſent over to the Lords Juſtices, and printed at <hi>Dublin</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>November,</hi> fully declared their reſolutions for the vigorous proſecution of the war of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Nay, the Cities of <hi>Galway</hi> and <hi>Limeric,</hi> kept their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns very covertly, not doing any open acts of hoſtility, till after the arrivall of ſome Forces at <hi>Dublin</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> and that the ſiege of <hi>Drohedagh</hi> or <hi>Tredagh</hi> was raiſed, and thoſe bold perfidious Traitors beaten back into the North, the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> baniſhed by force of his Majeſties Arms out of their own habitations, which were all ſpoiled and laid waſte.</p>
            <p>Now that then they ſhould declare themſelves, is more then a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to me, and ſuch a myſtery, as I ſhould not know what to think of, but that I find in the Lord <hi>Mac Guires</hi> relation before mentioned, that they were acquainted with the firſt beginnings of this great plot, and had a particular intereſt from time to time in the carriage of it on, ſo as I think I ſhall not wrong them poſitively, to determine, that they were too deeply engaged ſlightly to retire; and that howſoever upon the failing of it in the main piece, they at firſt ſtood at a gaze, and were put to take up ſecond Counſels; yet ſuch was the ſtrength of the conſpiracy, and their great confidence in the power of their arms, as made them appear in due time to entertain their ſeverall aſſignations, and act their parts with great diligence and iuduſtry. The wife of <hi>Philip O Rely</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> told <hi>James Talbot</hi> (as he openly related it to the Lords Juſtices at Counſel Board) that ſhe wondred very much the Lords and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale</hi> did not riſe and joyn with them in the very beginning of this Rebellion, adding theſe words, or to this effect; that if they would have let us alone, and not ſet us on, we were ſo well at eaſe, as we would never have begun this troubleſom work. It cannot certainly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh Pale</hi> (unleſſe they had been the firſt projectors, or deep adventurers) would have yeelded that the meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould have ſeized upon the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> places of refuge for them in all former troubles, and which would now
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114601:47"/> have given them protection and ſafety againſt the incurſions of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hold it not neceſſary to produce further evidence in this particular; I purpoſe now to declare how thoſe great Inſtruments of miſchief, that were the ſupream conductors of this wicked deſign, moved forwards ſo ſuccesfully in the beginning, toward the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their long intended extirpation of all the Britiſh and Proteſtants out of the Kingdom.<note place="margin">The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy and the Popiſh Lawyers great inſtruments in the firſt Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Rebellion.</note> I find two ſorts of perſons who did moſt eminently appear in laying thoſe main fundamentals wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon their bloody ſuperſtructions were afterwards eaſily reared up: And theſe were ſuch of the popiſh Lawyers as were natives of the Kingdome, and thoſe of the Romiſh Clergy of ſeverall degrees and orders. For the firſt, they had in regard of their knowledge in the Laws of the Land, very great reputation and truſt, they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtand up like great Patriots for the vindication of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject, and redreſſe of their pretended grievances, and having by their bold appearing therein, made a great party in the houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yers draw a great party in the Houſe of Commons to adhere to them</note> here then ſitting, ſome of them did there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially obtrude, as undoubted maximes of Law, the pernicious ſpeculations of their own brain, which though plainly diſcerned to be full of virulency and tending to ſedition, yet ſo ſtrangely were many of the Proteſtants and well meaning men in the houſe blinded with an apprehenſion of eaſe and redreſſe, and ſo ſtupified with their bold accuſations of the government, as moſt thought not fit, others durſt not ſtand up to contradict their fond aſſertions; ſo as what they ſpake was received with great acclamation, and much applauſe by moſt of the Proteſtant Members of the houſe; many of which under ſpecious pretences of publike zeale to this Country, they had inveigled into their party: And then it was, that having impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Sir <hi>Richard Bolton,</hi> Lord Chancelour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of high treaſon, together with other prime Officers and Miniſters of State that were of Engliſh birth, ſome of thoſe great Maſters took upon them with much confidence to declare the Law, to make new expoſitions of their own upon the Text, to frame their <hi>Queres,</hi> challenges fitter to be taken to a long, wilfully, over-grown miſgovernment, then to be made againſt an authority, that had for many yeers ſtruggled againſt the beloved irregularities of a ſtubborn people, and which had prevailed far beyond former times, towards the allaying of the long continued diſtempers of the Kingdom: They diſdained the moderate qualifications of the Judges, who gave them modeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſuch as the Law and duty to their Soveraign would admit.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114601:47"/> But thoſe would not ſerve their turn, they reſolved upon an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the government, and drawing of it wholly into the hands of the Natives, which they knew they could not compas in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way, and therefore only made preparatives there, and delivered ſuch deſperate maximes, which being diffuſed abroad would fit and diſpoſe the people to a change: As they declared it to be Law, that being killed in Rebellion, though found by matter of record, would give the King no forfeiture of eſtate; that though many thouſands ſtood up in arms in a Kingdom, working all manner of deſtruction, yet if they profeſſed not to riſe againſt the King, that it was no Rebellion: That if a man were out-lawed for Treaſon, and his land thereby veſted in the Crown or given away by the King, his heir might come afterwards and be admitted to reverſe the Outlawry, and recover his Anceſtors eſtate. And many other poſitions of a perilous conſequence, tending to ſedition and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, did they continue to publiſh during that Seſſion, and by the power and ſtrength of their party, ſo far did they prevail at laſt, as they preſumed to attempt a ſuſpenſion of <hi>Poynings</hi> Act, and indeed intended the utter abrogation of that Statute, which remains as one of the greateſt tyes and beſt monuments the Engliſh have of their entire dominion over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, and the annexion of that Kingdom to the imperiall Crown of <hi>England.</hi> They further aſſumed power of Judicature to the Parliament in criminall and capitall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: A right which no former age hath left any preſident for, neither would this admit the example.</p>
            <p>And thus carrying all things before them, they continued the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Parliament begun in <hi>May,</hi> till about two moneths before the firſt breaking out of this Rebellion; it being very ill taken, that even then they were adjourned. And this they have ſince aggravated as a high crime againſt the Lords Juſtices, and as one of the chief moving cauſes to the taking up of Arms generally throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>But to let thoſe things paſſe, how finely ſoever theſe proceedings were carried on, and being covered over with pretences of zeale and publike affection, paſſed then currant without any manner of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition; yet now the eyes of all men are opened, and they are fully reſolved that all theſe paſſages, together with the other high conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations in Parliament, not to have the newly raiſed <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, the importunate ſolicitation of their Agents in <hi>England,</hi> to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114601:48"/> have the old Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> caſhiered, and the Kingdom left to be defended by Trained Bands of their owne Nation. As likewiſe the Commiſſions procured by ſeverall of the moſt eminent Commanders now in Rebellion, for the raiſing men to carry into <hi>Spain,</hi> were all partes of this Plot, Prologues to this enſuing Tragedy, Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſuch as had bin long laid to bring on the ſodain execution of this moſt bloody Deſigne, all at one and the ſame time throughout the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The meanes uſed by the Prieſts &amp; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits to ſtir up the people to rebell.</note>Now for the Jeſuits, Prieſts, Fryers, and all the reſt of the vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fraternity belonging to their holy Orders; who, as I ſaid, had a main part to Act, and have not failed with great aſſiduity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to diſcharge the ſame. They loſt no time, but moſt dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applyed themſelves in all parts of the Country to lay ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous impreſſions in the minds, as well of the meaner ſort as of the chiefe Gentlemen, as might make them ready to take fire upon the firſt occaſion. And when this Plot was ſo ſurely, as they thought, laid, as it could not well faile, and the day once prefixed for execution; they did in their publicke Devotions long before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend by their Prayers, the good ſucceſſe of a great Deſigne, much tending to the proſperity of the Kingdome, and the advancement of the Catholick cauſe. And for the facilitating of the Worke, and ſtirring up of the people with greater animoſity and cruelty to put it on at the time prefixed; they loudly in all places declamed againſt the Proteſtants; telling the people that they were Hereticks, and not to be ſuffered any longer to live among them; that it was no more ſinne to kill an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> then to kill a dogge; and that it was a moſt mortall and unpardonable ſinne to relieve or protect any of them. Then alſo they repreſented with much acrimony the ſevere courſes taken by the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> for the ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion in all parts of the Kingdome, and utter extirpation of all profeſſors of it. They told the people that in <hi>England</hi> they had cauſed the Queens Prieſt to be hanged before her own face, and that they held her Majeſty in her owne perſon under a moſt ſevere diſcipline: That the ſame cruell Laws againſt Popery were here or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be put ſodainly in execution; and a deſigne ſecretly laid for bringing and ſeizing upon all the principal Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the 23. of <hi>November</hi> next enſuing; and ſo to make a generall Maſſacre of all that would not deſert their Religion and preſently become Proteſtants.</p>

               </note>And now alſo did they take occaſion to revive their inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and ancient animoſities againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, whom they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114601:48"/> repreſented to themſelves as hard Maſters; under whoſe government, how pleaſant, comfortable and advantagious ſo ever it was, they would have the world beleeve they had endured a moſt miſerable captivity and envaſſalage. They looked with much envie upon their proſperity, conſidering all the Land they poſſeſſed (though a great part bought at high rates of the Natives) as their owne proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. They grudged at the great multitudes of their faire <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Cattell; at their goodly Houſes, though built by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry at their own charges; at the large improvements they made of their Eſtates, by their own travails and carefull endevours. They ſpake with much ſcorne and contempt of ſuch as brought little with them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having there planted themſelves, in a little time contracted great fortunes: they were much troubled, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Countries, to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> live handſomely, and to have every thing with much decency about them, while they lay na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily buried, as it were, in mire and filthineſſe; the ordinary ſort of people commonly bringing their Cattle into their owne ſtinking Creates, and there naturally delighting to lye among them. Theſe malignant conſiderations made them with an envious eye impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to looke upon all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> lately come over into the Kingdome. Nothing leſſe then a generall extirpation will now ſerve their turne; they muſt have reſtitution of all the Lands to the proper Natives, whom they take to be the ancient proprietors, and onely true own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, moſt unjuſtly deſpoiled by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom they hold to have made undue acquiſitions of all the Land they poſſeſſe by gift from the Crown, upon the attainder of any of their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>And ſo impetuous were the deſires of the Natives to draw the whole Government of the Kingdome into their owne hands,<note place="margin">The ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the firſt plotters of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the publicke profeſſion of their Religion, as well as to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Country of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> inhabitants ſeated therein, as they made the whole body of the State to be univerſally diſliked; repreſented the ſeverall members as perſons altogether corrupt and ill affected; pretended the ill humours and diſtempers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be growen to that height as required Cauteries, deepe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and indeed nothing able to worke ſo great a cure, but an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Rebellion. This was certainly the diſeaſe, as appeares by all the ſymptomes, and the joynt concurrence in opinion of all the great Phyſitians that held themſelves wiſe enough to propoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and preſcribe fit applications to ſo deſperate a Malady. In thoſe Inſtructions privately ſent over into <hi>England</hi> by the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Costeloz,</hi> preſently after the breaking out of the Rebellion, the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114601:49"/> of the ſupream power in the government and ſetling of it in the hands of the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> giving leave to the Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Kingdome to remove ſuch Officers of State as they thought fit, and to recommend Natives to their places, were there poſitively laid down to be a more likely meanes to appeaſe theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults then a conſiderable Army. In the Remonſtrance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Longford,</hi> preſented about the ſame time to the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, by the ſame Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> as alſo in the frame of the Common-wealth, found at Sir <hi>John Dungars</hi> Houſe, not farre from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſent up thither out of <hi>Conaught</hi> to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to thoſe of <hi>Lemſter;</hi> peeces which publikely appeared ſoon after the breaking out of the Rebellion; the main points inſiſted upon in them and ſeverall others,<note place="margin">The true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> were reſtauration of the Publick profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; reſtitution of all the Plantation Lands unto the Natives, and ſettlement of the preſent Government in their hands.

               <p>Theſe are the means propoſed by theſe Catholick Remonſtrants, for reducing of the Kingdom to peace, theſe the great obſtructions they would have removed, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant Counſel they would have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſetling the tranquility &amp; preſent government of this Land; ſo as we need ſeek no further evidence, nor make any more curious enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the ſecret cauſes of their firſt riſing: we have here enough out of their owne mouths, to reſolve the moſt ſcrupulous unbeleever of their firſt motives to this Rebellion.<note place="margin">The re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion onely a pretence for the rebellion.</note> And now for the matter of Religion, howſoever I am very confident they ever really intended the re-eſtabliſhment of that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the Rites and Ceremonies thereof, together with the utter extirpation of all of the reformed profeſſion: Yet conſidering the large indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and free liberty they univerſally enjoyed at that time in the full exerciſe of that their Religion throughout all the parts of the Kingdome; it may be moſt juſtly ſuſpected (how zealouſly ſoever they now obtrude it) that this was onely the bare outward couver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114601:50"/> made uſe of by the principall undertakers, to draw on a poore ignorant ſuperſtitious people to ſacrifice their lives in this quarrell. Neither can it by any reaſonable man be ever preſumed, that ſuch perſons as made no conſcience of committing treaſon, ſo many cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell murders, and all other kind of abominable villanies, not to be paralleld in any other Country, could be drawne meerly out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, to act theſe for the regaining of the free and publike profeſſion of their Religion.</p>
               <p>This certainly was no more the true and main cauſe of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Armes, then the redreſſe of their pretended grievances,<note place="margin">All the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed before the Rebellion brake out.</note> whereunto his Majeſty had condiſcended, and out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations for their preſent reliefe, had given much more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their Agents lately in <hi>England,</hi> then ever they could in any other time expect to receive or hope to enjoy. Yet we ſee how little effect thoſe great graces brought over not above two moneths before this Rebellion brake out, took among them: for preſently after the return of their Agents with them, this moſt deteſtable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which had been long in hatching, began to work, and to be put in execution. And if we ſhall conſider their maine deſigne and chiefe ends therein, as they appear in their firſt principles, or will give credit to the ſeverall ſpeeches and paſſages that we meet with among the Rebels, in the very beginning of their breaking out; as alſo to ſeverall other teſtimonies that have ſince privately fallen from ſome particular perſons among them, we muſt beleeve that their deſigne cleerly was to deſtroy and root out all the Britiſh and Proteſtants planted within this Kingdom, to cut off the Soveraignty of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to deliver themſelves from their long continued ſubjection to the Engliſh Nation.</p>
               <p>But to come to one maine particular, taken into debate by the prime Movers and chiefe incendiaries in this horrid Rebellion,<note place="margin">A Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be beſt to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or onely to baniſh all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> out of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> they had a moſt ſerious conſultation what courſe to take with moſt ſafety to themſelves, for the disburthening of the Kingdome of thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which were in very great numbers diſperſedly planted among them. Some were of opinion that they ſhould ſpare their lives, not render themſelves guilty of the ſpilling of ſo much innocent blood, but that they ſhould ſeize on their goods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them their habitations, and after baniſhing them out of the Kingdome, proceed as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did with many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the <hi>Moors,</hi> whom, as it were in a moment, they cleered out of their Dominions. Others there were who much oppoſed this kind of lenity and moderation, remonſtrating the high inconveniences
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114601:51"/> which would inevitably redound to themſelves thereby. Firſt, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> were in ſo great numbers, as they could not either by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming, impriſoning, or any other meanes poſſible, ever hope to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from miſchiefe: Then that if they onely expelled them out of the Kingdome, they would remain ſtill as ſo many fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to be entertained in <hi>England,</hi> and from thence returned backe full of revengefull thoughts to recover their loſſes; that by their long experience and knowledge in the Country they would be better guides, more deeply engaged to proſecute the Warre; and having their bodies inured to this Climate, would prove much more able Souldiers then any new men that could be raiſed, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes brought over. How they determined this particular I ſhall not undertake to declare; my intelligence failes me, and I am able to deliver no more of the reſult of this great Councell then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the bloody effects and horrid executions acted in the firſt beginnings of their Rebellion. It is moſt probable they came to no poſitive concluſion, but left the chiefe Actors in this particular at large, to doe as ſhould ſeem good to themſelves. We finde their firſt proceedings and outrages committed upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very various and much differing in ſeverall places; ſome onely ſtripping and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of them; others, murdering Man, Woman and Childe without mercy. But this is certain, and of moſt unqueſtionable truth, that by one means or other, they reſolved univerſally to root all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Proteſtants out of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  </note> And that theſe were the firſt thoughts and bitter fruits of the long premeditated malicious intentions, ſufficiently appeares by their Actions, as well as by their virulent expreſſions uttered upon their firſt riſing, when they thought the Kingdome their own. They then ſaid openly, that they meant to deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they had made a Covenant no <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> ſhould ſet footing among them. Some of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would not endure the very ſound of that language,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> in many places killed <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cowes and Sheep meerly becauſe they were <hi>Engliſh;</hi> in ſome places they cut off their legges, or tooke out a peece out of their buttocks, and ſo let them remain ſtill alive.

               <p>And ſo fond and vein were their imaginations, and to ſuch a height of madneſſe were they grown, as they could not terminate their thoughts in the reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> under the power of their own Nation. But as ſoon as they had begun their Rebellion there, they ſpake confidently in all places of tranſporting their Armes into <hi>England,</hi> that they would ſend 30000 men over into that Kingdom, and that they would draw in foraign Auxiliaries thither to joyn with them; and ſo by a high hand eſtabliſh the free exerciſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion within that Kingdom. A Deſigne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114601:52"/> which the Prieſts and Jeſuits had taken up in their own thoughts, and by their correſpondencies abroad intended power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to bring about, as ſoon as they had ſetled their affaires in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And if it had not pleaſed God in an extraordinay way to bring the firſt Plot to light, and ſo to bleſſe the weake endevours of the State here, as to enable them by the aſſiſtance of thoſe ſmall Forces they confuſedly gathered together, to hold out till the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the Succours ſent out of <hi>England;</hi> I leave it to every one to conſider with how much advantage they might have gone on at that time towards the accompliſhment of ſo deſperate a Project. And for my ſelfe, I muſt profeſſe that I am cleerly reſolved, that had they at firſt overmaſtered the unexpected difficulties and fatall impediments they met withall at home, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the Arms and Munition within the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo fleſht and blooded in the ſlaughter of many thouſands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, had tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a numerous Army of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, and ſodainly landed them in ſome good Port within the Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> They would have prevailed very farre towards the miſerable deſolation and ruine thereof. It muſt be remembred in what a moſt unhappy diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the affaires were at that time there; what a diſeaſed body the State then had, and what high diſtempers then ſtrongly working ſoone after brake out; what a ſtrong party they might have found within, and with what great reputation they would have marched on under the glory of their late victories atchieved in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalizing the power of their armes with ſuch horrid cruelties and bloody butcheries, as would have wrought a ſtrange terror among the people.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what were the Cauſes and firſt Motives to this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Rebellion; as likewiſe who were the chiefe Actors and the great inſtruments deſigned by the firſt Plotters to prediſpoſe the people to a readineſſe to take Armes for the rooting out of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Inhabitants from among them. The Preparatives being all made, the Plot in all points ripe for execution, it was carried on to the very evening before the day appointed for the taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> without diſcovery. And though it pleaſed God to bring it then to light (as hath been declared) and ſo happily to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint it in the maine Peece, yet it tooke in the Northerne parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that very day fully executed in moſt of the chiefe places of ſtrength within the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster.</hi> And whereas the Prieſts did long before in their publick Devotions at Maſſe pray for a bleſſing upon a great Deſigne they had then in hand; ſo now, as I have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114601:52"/> heard, they did in many places, the very day before the breaking out of this Rebellion, give the people a diſmiſſe at Maſſe, with free liberty to goe out and take poſſeſſion of all their Lands, which they pretended, unjuſtly detained from them by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> as alſo to ſtrip, rob, and diſpoyle them of all their Goods and Cattell. They had without doubt, by one meanes or other, either private or publick inſtructions not to leave to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> any thing that might afford the leaſt comfort or hope of longer ſubſiſtance among them.

Much likewiſe they got by faire promiſes and deep engagements to doe them no further miſchief, to ſuffer them, their wives and children quietly to retire and leave the Country: But others, and eſpecially the meaner ſort of people fell more rudely to work, at the very firſt, breaking up of their houſes, and uſing all manner of force and violence, to make themſelves maſters of their goods.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat by command from Sir <hi>Phelim O Neile,</hi> the Rebels dragged the Deponents brother, Lieutenant <hi>James Maxwell</hi> out of his bed in the rage and height of a burning Feaver; and leaſt any of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance or friends ſhould bury him, they carried him two miles from any Church, and there cruelly butchered him, when he neither knew what he did or ſaid; and thus Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> paid him two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty pound which he owed him: And his wife <hi>Griſſell Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> being in child-birth, the child halfe born and halfe unborne, they ſtript ſtarke naked, drove her about an arrowes flight to the Black-water, and drowned her: The like they did to another <hi>Engliſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſame Pariſh, in the beginning of the Rebellion, which was little inferiour, if not more unnaturall and barbarous then the roaſting of Maſter <hi>Watſon</hi> alive, after they had cut a collop out of either buttock. And farther ſaith, that a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> woman was found in the <hi>Glinwood,</hi> lying dead, her belly ripped up, and a living child
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114601:71"/> crawling in her wombe, cut out of the Cawle; and that Maſter <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> School-Maſter at <hi>Armagh,</hi> he a Gentleman of good Parentage and parts, being upwards of an hundred yeers of age, they ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, cauſed two of his Daughters, Virgins, being likewiſe naked, to ſupport him under each arme, he being not able to goe of himſelfe: And in that poſture carried them all three a quarter of a mile, to a turfe pit, and drowned them, feeding the luſts of their eyes, and the cruelty of their hearts with the ſelf-ſame objects at the ſame time. At the ſiege of <hi>Augher,</hi> they would not kill any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beaſt, and then eat it, but they cut collops out of them being alive, letting them there rore till they had no more fleſh upon their backs, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Beaſt would live two or three days together in that torment; the like they did at <hi>Armagh,</hi> when they murdered <hi>Hugh Echlin,</hi> Eſquire, they hanged and murdered all his <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſervants which had any way proved faithfull or uſefull to him during this Rebellion: And as touching exemplary conſtancy in Religion, this Deponent ſaith, that <hi>Henry Cowell,</hi> Eſquire, a gallant and well bred Gentleman, was murdered becauſe he would not conſent to marry a beaſtly Trull, <hi>Mary Ny Neile,</hi> a neer Kinſwoman of Sir <hi>Phelim's:</hi> He was proffered his life, without the <hi>Blouſe,</hi> if he would have gone to Maſſe, but he choſe rather to dye then to doe either. There was made the like proffer of life for going to Maſſe to <hi>Robert Eckline,</hi> a child of eleven or twelve yeers of age, but he alſo refuſed it, ſaying, he ſaw nothing in their Religion for which he would change his owne. And this Deponent further ſaith, that very many of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants the Rebels buried alive, and took great pleaſure to heare them ſpeak unto them as they digged downe old ditches upon them; except thoſe whom they thus buried, they buried none of the Proteſtants, neither would permit any who ſurvived to performe that duty for them: And further ſaith, that the Rebels would ſend their children abroad in great troops, eſpecially neer unto <hi>Kinard,</hi> armed with long wattles and whips, who would therewith beat dead mens bodies about their privy members, untill they beat, or rather thraſhed, them off, and then would returne in great joy to their Parents, who received them for ſuch ſervice as it were in triumph. And further ſaith, that if any women were found dead lying with their faces downwards, they would turne them upon their backs, and in great flocks reſort unto them, cenſuring all parts of their bodies, but eſpecially ſuch as are not fit to be named, which afterwards they abuſed ſo many wayes, and ſo filthily, as chaſt ears would not endure the very naming thereof.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:114601:71"/>
               <p>Many of the Proteſtants the Rebels would not kill out-right, but being halfe dead would ſo leave them, entreating for no better favour at their hands two or three dayes after, but to kill them out-right, which ſometimes were granted, ſometimes denied.</p>
               <p>A young youth having his back-bone broken, was found in a field having like a Beaſt eaten all the graſſe round about him; the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent could not learne that they killed him out, but that they remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to a place of better Paſture, ſo that in thoſe moſt bloody and execrable wretches, that of the holy Ghoſt is cleerly verified, <hi>The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercy of the wicked is cruelty:</hi> And further ſaith, that the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves told him, this Deponent, that they murdered 954. in one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the County of <hi>Antrim;</hi> and that beſides them, they ſuppoſed that they killed above 1100. or 1200. more in that County: They told him likewiſe, that Colonell <hi>Bryan O Neile</hi> killed about one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> beſides three hundred killed neere <hi>Killeleigh,</hi> and many hundreds both before and after in both thoſe Counties.</p>
               <p>At Sir <hi>Phelims</hi> return from <hi>Liſnegarvy</hi> ſome of the Souldiers forced about 24. <hi>Britiſh</hi> into a houſe, where they burned them alive, whoſe terrible out-cryes they deſired very much to imitate and expreſſe unto others: And ſaith, that he heard Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> likewiſe report, that he killed 600. <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Garvagh</hi> in the County of <hi>Derny;</hi> and that he had left neither man, woman nor Child alive in the Barony of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlong</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Armagh</hi> and the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> in the ſeverall Plantations and Lands of Sir <hi>Archibald Atcheſon, John Hamilton,</hi> Eſquire, the Lord <hi>Canfield,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mount Norrice:</hi> and ſaith alſo, that there were above two thouſand of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> murdered for the moſt part in their owne houſes, whereof he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a <hi>Scotch</hi> man, who was in thoſe parts with Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> and ſaw their houſes filled with their dead bodies. In the <hi>Glenwood</hi> towards <hi>Dromore,</hi> there were ſlaughtered, as the Rebels told the Deponent, upwards of twelve thouſand in al, who were all killed in their flight to the County of <hi>Downe:</hi> The number of the people drowned at the Bridge of <hi>Portadowne,</hi> are diverſly reported according as men ſtaid amongſt the Rebels, this Deponent who ſtaid as long as any, and had better intelligence then moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> amongſt them, and had beſt reaſon to know the truth, ſaith, there were (by their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) 190. drowned with Maſter <hi>Fullerton:</hi> At another time they threw 140. over the ſaid Bridge; at another time 36. or 37. and ſo continued drowning more or fewer, for ſeven or eight weeks, ſo as the feweſt which can be ſuppoſed there to have periſhed, muſt needs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114601:72"/> be above 1000. beſides as many more drowned betwixt that Bridge and the great <hi>Lowgh</hi> of <hi>Montjoy,</hi> beſids thoſe who periſhed by the ſword fire and famine, in <hi>Coubraſſill,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> plantations adjacent: Which in regard there eſcaped not 300. out of all thoſe quarters muſt needs amount to many thouſands.</p>
               <p>Neere unto the Deponants Houſe thirty ſix perſons were carryed to the <hi>Cure-bridge</hi> at one time, and drowned. At another time ſix and fifty, Men, Women and Children; all of them being taken out of the Deponents Houſe; and at ſeverall other times ſeverall other numbers; Beſides thoſe that were drowned in the Black-water at <hi>Kinnard.</hi> In which Towne and the Pariſh of <hi>Tinon</hi> (whereof the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent was Rector) there was drowned, ſlaughtered and dyed of Famine, and for want of Cloathes, about ſix hundred. The Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent might adde to theſe many thouſands more; but the Diary which he this Deponent wrote amongſt the Rebels, being burned, with his Houſe,<note place="margin">The numbers of <hi>Britiſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed within the Province of <hi>Ulſter.</hi>
                  </note> Bookes and all his Papers; he referreth himſelfe to the number in groſſe, which the Rebels themſelves have upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, finde out and acknowledged; which notwithſtanding will come ſhort of all that have been Murdered in <hi>Ireland;</hi> there being above one hundred and fifty foure thouſand now wanting of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> within the very precinct of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Deponent further ſaith, That it was common Table-talke amongſt the Rebels, that the Ghoſt of Maſter <hi>William Fuller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Timothy Jephes,</hi> and the moſt of thoſe who were throwne over <hi>Portadowne-Bridge,</hi> were daily and nightly ſeene to walke upon the River, ſometimes ſinging of Pſalmes, ſometimes brandiſhing of naked Swords, ſometimes ſcrieching in a moſt hideous and fearefull manner. The Deponent did not beleeve the ſame at firſt, neither doth he yet know whether to beleeve it or no; but ſaith that divers of the Rebels aſſured him that they themſelves did dwell neere to the ſame River, and being daily affrighted with thoſe apparitions, but eſpecially with their horrible ſcriech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were in concluſion inforced to remove further into the Country: Their owne Prieſts and Fryers could not deny the truth thereof. But as it was by the Deponent Objected unto them; ſaid it was but a cunning flight of the Devill to hinder this great worke of propagating the Catholicke Faith, and killing of Heretickes; or that it was wrought by Witchcraft. The Deponent himſelfe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within thirteen miles of the Bridge, and never heard any man ſo much as doubt of the truth thereof. Howſoever, he obligeth no mans faith, in regard he ſaw it not with his owne eyes; otherwiſe he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114601:72"/> had as much certainty as morrally could be required of ſuch a matter.</p>
               <p>And this Deponent further ſaith; That the degenerate <hi>Pale Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> were moſt cruell amongſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants, being beaten from their owne Lands; and were never ſatisfied with their blood, untill they had in a manner ſeen the laſt drop thereof; affrighting Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> every day with their numbers, and perſwading him, That whileſt they (meaning the Proteſtants) lived, there would neither be roome for them, nor ſafety for him. It was eaſie to ſpur on the cowardly and bloody Rebell; yet no ſooner were the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cut off, but contrary to their expectation, the meere <hi>Iriſh</hi> tooke preſent poſſeſſion of their Lands and Houſes; whereat the <hi>Pale Engliſh</hi> much grumbled; and ſaid, Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> had not kept promiſe with them; howſoever, they were forced to ſwallow thoſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other injuries.</p>
               <p>And further ſaith, that he knew one Boy, that dwelt neere unto himſelfe, and not exceeding fourteen yeers of age, who killed at <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> in one night, fifteen able ſtrong men with his Skeine, they being diſarmed, and moſt of their feet in the Stocks.</p>
               <p>Another not above twelve yeers of age, killed two women at the Siedge of <hi>Augher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another that was a woman and Tenant to this Deponent, killed ſeven men and women, of her fellow <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tenants, in one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And it was very uſuall in all parts, for the Rebels children to murther the Proteſtants children; and ſometimes with Lath-ſwords heavie, and well ſharpned, they would venture upon people of riper yeers (cruelties not to be beleeved) if there were not ſo many eye-witneſſes of them.</p>

               <p>I finde in one part of Doctor <hi>Maxwels</hi> Examination (which I thought not fit wholly to inſert, becauſe it is of great length, and many particulars in it, nothing tending to that purpoſe for which it is former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned) that about <hi>May</hi> 1642. when the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army under the command of Generall Major <hi>Monro</hi> had marched down from <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> taken in the <hi>Newry,</hi> beaten the <hi>Iriſh</hi> out of thoſe Parts with the ſlaughter of many of them; Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale</hi> cauſed 5000 <hi>Britiſh</hi> whom he detained in <hi>Armagh, Tyrone,</hi> and other Parts of the North, to be moſt miſerably murdered in the ſpace of three dayes: <hi>James Shaw</hi> of Market Hill in the County of <hi>Armagh,</hi> depoſeth and ſaith, that during the time this Deponent was in reſtraint, and ſtayed among the <hi>Rebels,</hi> he obſerved and well knew that the greateſt part of the <hi>Rebels</hi> in the County of <hi>Armagh</hi> went to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Augher</hi> where they were repulſed, and divers of the <hi>Rebels</hi> of the ſept of <hi>O-Neals</hi> ſlaine: In revenge whereof, the grand <hi>Rebell</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale</hi> gave direction and warrant to one <hi>Mulmory Mac Donell,</hi> a moſt cruell and mercileſſe <hi>Rebell,</hi> to kill all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> within the Pariſhes of <hi>Mullebrack Logilly</hi> and <hi>Kilcluney,</hi> whereupon the ſaid <hi>Rebell</hi> did murder 27 <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants within Musket ſhot of this Deponents own houſe; and further ſaith that in thoſe three Pariſhes there have been before that and ſince, by killing, drowning, and ſtarving, put to death above 1500 Proteſtants within the ſaid three Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Fiz-Gerald</hi> a Clerk of Iriſh birth, dwelling neare <hi>Armagh,</hi> and there reſiding when this Rebellion brake out, depoſeth and ſaith, That all places of the North where Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale</hi> under the name of Generall of the Catholike Army commanded, were filled with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Proteſtants: And that when at <hi>Augher, Liſnagarue,</hi> or any other places the <hi>Rebels</hi> received loſſe of their men, thoſe that eſcaped, exerciſed their cruelty upon the Proteſtants everywhere at their return: And that about the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1642. when Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale</hi> had notice of the taking of the <hi>Newry</hi> by his Majeſties Forces, he retired that night in all haſte to the Town of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the next day as well the Town of <hi>Armagh</hi> as the Cathedrall Church there, and all the Villages and Houſes in the Countrey round about together with all proviſions were fired by the <hi>Rebels;</hi> and many men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, murdered as well in the Towne as in the Countrey round about.</p>
               <p>There is much more to be ſaid on this ſubject, but I ſhall forbeare to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114601:78"/> rake further into many other ſoule circumſtances, which would make this Rebellion appeare farre more odious and deteſtable. I ſhall now return to take up the publike affaires of the State, where I left them in the hands of the Lords Juſtices and Councell, who finding the City to grow daily more and more impeſtred with ſtrangers by reaſon of the reſort of great numbers of ill-affected perſons that daily made repaire thereunto: They iſſued out ſeverall other Proclamations to prohibite the acceſſe of all ſtrangers to the Town, and to require ſuch as remained in the City without calling or ſettled habitation, to depart.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> being diſpatched with his Regiment of foot to <hi>Tredagh</hi> as is formerly mentioned,<note place="margin">Some Troops of horſe and Regiments of foot raiſed by the Lords Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Councell.</note> the Lords Juſtices took further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the preſent raiſing of other foot Companies; as likewiſe ſome Troopes of horſe which might ſerve for the defence of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> now in moſt imminent danger by reaſon of the approaches made by the Forces of the <hi>Rebels.</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> had a Commiſſion for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, which he quickly made up out of the poor ſtript <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had repaired from divers parts even naked to the Town, and upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the State procured cloaths for them. The Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> to whom a Commiſſion alſo was granted for the raiſing of an other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, began alſo to get ſome men together. The Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> was now arrived in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and brought up with him his Troop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 100 Curaſſiers compleatly armed; Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> who had long commanded a Troop of horſe in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Armeſtrong</hi> ſome time after, yet very ſeaſonably came thither: Both of them had money impreſted, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> to compleat his Troope already brought out of <hi>England,</hi> Captaine <hi>Armeſtrong</hi> to raiſe a new Troop; Captaine <hi>Yarner</hi> alſo arrived ſoon after at <hi>Dublin,</hi> he was ſent out of <hi>England</hi> by the Lord Lievtenant to raiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Troop, which in a very ſhort time he made up about 100 horſe, many perſons then living in the Town being deſirous to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their horſes into that Troop: Not long after Colonell <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> came over alſo, and bringing with him Letters of Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> then attending his Majeſty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under whom he had formerly the command of a Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons in <hi>Germany:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parliament.</note>In the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> before the Rebellion brake out, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adjourned to the 17 of <hi>November</hi> next enſuing: Now upon the diſcovery of the late conſpiracy for the ſurpriſe of his Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the ordinary place of meeting for both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Lords finding that the fire was begun in the North, and fearing a generall revolt of all other parts of the Kingdome, reſolved as a matter highly tending to the ſafety and ſecurity of the City and Caſtle to prorogue the Parliament, which they did by Proclamation then ſet out, untill the 24. of <hi>February.</hi> But two or three dayes before ſuch of the Lords and Commons then in the Town were to meet of courſe in their ſeverall Houſe for declaring the ſaid Prorogation, it was generally noiſed abroad that the putting off the Parliament was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely ill taken by the Popiſh Members of both Houſes. Mr <hi>Burk</hi> who was one of the Committee lately employed into <hi>England,</hi> came to the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> Weſt, and highly complaining of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which (he ſaid) was done thereby to the whole Nation hindring them from expreſſing their loyall affections to his Majeſty, and ſhewing their deſires to quell this dangerous Rebellion, and that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reſent it ſo farre as to complaine to the King thereof as a point of high injuſtice; His Lordſhip having acquainted the Board here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, Mr <hi>Burk</hi> was preſently ſent for, and he uſed the ſame language in effect there, though with much modeſty.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Lords fell into debate what was fit to be done, and how farre it might be thought reaſonable in them to condiſcend to their deſires:<note place="margin">The Popiſh party much diſcontented at it.</note> Some were of opinion that it was fit to diſannull the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, and to give them leave to continue the Parliament according to the firſt adjournment made the beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> They urged the very ill condition of the whole Kingdome in regard of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Rebellion, and that thoſe of the Counties of <hi>Wiclow</hi> and <hi>Wexford,</hi> as well as ſome other Counties in <hi>Conaght</hi> had already joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114601:79"/> to them; that this Prorogation might peradventure ſo irritate the <hi>Pale,</hi> and have ſuch an influence into <hi>Munſter</hi> as might raiſe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Armes, and ſo put the whole Kingdome into a generall combuſtion. Others of the Board Voted ſtrongly for the holding of the Prorogation according to the time prefixed by the Proclamation grounding their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon theſe reaſons: Firſt, that it would highly trench upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and wiſdome of the Board to alter a reſolution ſo ſolemnly taken up, after a moſt ſerious debate and publikely made known thorough out the whole Kingdome by Proclamation; that it would be of moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to bring ſo great a multitude of people to the City in ſuch dangerous times, that the Proteſtants and well-affected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houſes were for the moſt part either deſtroyed, diſperſed, or ſo ſhut up as they could not repaire to the preſent meeting, and that therefore the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would be ſuperiour in number and voyces, and ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry all things according to their own humour; that conſidering the ſmall Forces then in the City, ſuch great numbers as might take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under colour of comming to the Parliament, to repaire thither, could not be admitted without apparent danger and diſturbance, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they might there finde as ill affections as they brought, and ſo both joyning together they might eaſily deſtroy the ſtate with the poore remainders of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in theſe Parts: Whereupon the Lords thought fit to hold to their Prorogation, yet to endeavour ſo to attemper and ſweeten it, as thoſe who were moſt averſe, might in ſome meaſure reſt ſatisfied therewith. And therefore after a long debate of all particular circumſtances, they came at length to this reſolution that the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Maſter of the Rolls, and Sir <hi>Pierce Crosby</hi> three Members of the Board, ſhould have a meeting with Mr <hi>Darcy,</hi> Mr <hi>Burk,</hi> and ſome others of the moſt active and powerfull Members of the Houſe of Commons, and that they ſhould let them know from the Lords, that they have underſtood of their good affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to doe ſomewhat in the Houſe that might tend towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this preſent Rebellion, that they approved extreame well thereof: And that howſoever they could by no meanes remove abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prorogation, yet that they would deſcend ſo far to their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to limit it to a ſhorter time, and that at preſent they would give them leave to ſit one whole day in caſe they would immediatly fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of making a cleer Proteſtation againſt the <hi>Rebels:</hi> As alſo, that they ſhould have liberty if they pleaſed to make choyce of ſome Members of their own Houſe to ſend down to Treat with the <hi>Rebels</hi> about laying down of Arms: And for their grievances that their Lordſhips would with all readineſſe receive them, and preſently tranſmit them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114601:80"/> over to his Majeſty for a ſpeedy redreſſe: All this was accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; the meeting was in the Gallery at Cork Houſe; Thoſe of the Houſe of Commons ſeemed at firſt to be extreamly troubled when they found there was no poſſibility of altering the preſent Prorogation: But upon a further debate when they came to underſtand how ready the Lords were to yeeld to their ſatisfaction, and that the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation ſhould be ſhortned, they ſeemed to reſt indifferently contented, undertook to make the Proteſtation in ſuch full and ample manner as was deſired, and that they would fall immediately upon it and make it the work of the whole day.</p>
               <p>Upon the 17 of <hi>November,</hi> the Lords and Commons met in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was held in the uſuall place of his Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:</hi> And for the better ſecurity of the place as well as of the perſons of thoſe that were to meet, there was a Guard of Musketiers appointed to attend during the time of their meeting, but ſuch care taken that they ſhould carry themſelves ſo free from giving any offence as no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of umbrage might be taken at their attendance there. The Houſes were both very thin, there were only in the Houſe of Peeres ſome few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, three or foure Lords of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and ſome two or three Biſhops. In the Houſe of Commons, they took into their conſideration upon their firſt meeting the framing of the Proteſtation againſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> But thoſe of the Popiſh party ſpake ſo ambiguouſly, and handled the matter ſo tenderly, as they could not be drawn to ſtile them by the name of <hi>Rebels:</hi> ſo as they ſent up unto the Lords a very meager cold Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt them, which being in their Houſe taken into debate, it was ſtrongly conteſted by the Proteſtant Lords that they ſhould be ſtiled <hi>Rebels,</hi> but that as ſtiffely oppoſed by the others.

The Northern <hi>Rebels</hi> were then ſo puffed up with their late victories over the poore ſurprized, unreſiſting <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe Parts, and had ſo deeply drenched their hands in the blood of thoſe innocents, as they thought to carry the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome before them, and therefore would yeeld to no Treaties, but in a moſt barbarous manner tore the Order of Parliament together with the Letter ſent unto them, and returned a moſt ſcornfull Anſwer, fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing thereby how farre they were from any thought of laying down Armes, or entertaining any overtures towards an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114601:84"/> to their expectation, they found there 24 Musketiers and 15 horſemen, who very ſtoutly defended the houſe as long as their powder laſted: The horſemen when they ſaw themſelves beſet ſo as they could be no further ſerviceable to the place, opened the gate, iſſued out and made their paſſage thorow the midſts of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and ſo notwithſtanding the oppoſition they made, eſcaped ſafe to <hi>Tredagh:</hi> The foot having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to accept of the quarter at firſt offered, reſolved to make good the place to the laſt man; they endured ſeverall aſſaults, ſlew 140 of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> before their powder failed them: and at laſt they gave up the place upon promiſe of quarter, which was not kept, for ſome of them were killed in cold blood, all were ſtripped, and two old decrepite men ſlaine, the houſe ranſaked, and all the goods carried away.</p>
               <p>Vpon the receit of Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn</hi>'s Letter, the Lords preſently took order for the marching away of the ſix hundred men,<note place="margin">Supplies both of horſe and foot ſent for the reliefe of <hi>Tredagh.</hi>

And next day his Lordſhip received an Anſwer from him of that Letter, with aſſurance that he would not faile to march out with competent Forces to meet them upon the way, which he did that very day accordingly perform, but they marching no further then <hi>Balrudry,</hi> and ſo lying that night eight miles ſhort of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> he miſſed of them, and ſo went not out (by what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or upon what reaſon I know not) the day following till the news of the defeat met him at the very gate of the Town where he ſtood with his men in a readineſſe to march towards them: The men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together untrained and unaccuſtomed to travell, and failing of proviſion by the way, which for their money they could not by any meanes procure
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114601:85"/> from the country people as they marched along, were very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and being ſomewhat tired with their journey went on next day, but in much diſorder, ſo careleſſe, and ſo little apprehenſive of any danger, as ſome had Armes, but no munition about them; others for their owne eaſe committed the carriage of both to the Carts. As they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> the Major went in to give a viſit to the Lord of <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> who told him that there were ſome Numbers of men lay in the way with an intent to interrupt their Paſſage. And this his Lordſhip knew very well, for the very night before (as Mr. <hi>Creeghton</hi> affirmes in his examination) one of his groomes went to <hi>Slaine</hi> where the Rebells were then lodged, and called them out of their Beds to be in a readineſſe to come and incounter the Engliſh forces now upon their march. The Major had likewiſe other advertiſements to the ſame purpoſe, which he neglected not ſo much as acquainting his Captaines therewith, as ſome of them afterwards affirmed; He onely cauſed three Scouts out of the Troop to be ſent abroad to make diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whether the paſſage were cleer; two of them returned back a little before he came to the bridge of <hi>Julians</hi> Town, aſſuring him all was cleer; the other went on to a houſe within one quarter of a mile of the place where the Rebels lay, and while he attended there for his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, a boy belonging to the houſe, took his Horſe, and riding to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels gave them notice of the neer approach of our forces: The Horſe paſſed the Bridge, and the Foot following turned up into a field on the left hand of the Lane, where by reaſon of a great miſt that ſuddenly fell, they diſcovered not the Rebels, till they were almoſt within Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of them.<note place="margin">The defeat of the forces ſent for the relief of <hi>Tredagh.</hi>
                  </note> The Major drew his men preſently into Battalia, but the Horſe (as ſome of the foot that eſcaped affirme) wheeled about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charging any part of the Rebells forces, who now furiouſly approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a great ſhout; and a Lieutenant giving out the unhappy word of Countermarch, all the men poſſeſſed as it were with a Pannick fear, began ſomewhat confuſedly to march back, but were ſo much amazed with a ſecond ſhout given by the Rebels (who ſeeing them in diſorder followed cloſe on) as notwithſtanding they had gotten into a ground of great advantage, they could not be perſwaded to ſtand a charge, but betook themſelves to their heels, and ſo the Rebels fell ſharply on, as their manner is upon the execution.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Weames</hi> without the loſſe of one Horſe paſſed on ſafely unto <hi>Tredagh:</hi> The Major with two of the Captains more, and about 100 of their men made an eſcape thither likewiſe: The other three Captains with all the reſt of the Souldiers that were Engliſh were there cut off, they ſpared very few or none that fell into their hands, but ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114601:85"/> as were Iriſh, whoſe lives they preſerved: The Armes of the whole ſix hundred they poſſeſſed themſelves of, as likewiſe of all their Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Carriages; and ſo highly were the <hi>Rebels</hi> encouraged with this defeat given to his Majeſties Forces, as the whole <hi>Pale</hi> began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to waver, they thought the Kingdome their own, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would in all parts fall before them, as thoſe poore ill conducted ſheep had unhappily done. And this is a true Relation (as neare as I could collect it from the mouthes of thoſe that were preſent) of that famous victory ſo much boaſted of by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whereunto the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders, and the diſorders of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers, who were then but newly taken up and had never ſeene any ſervice, contributed farre more then any skill or courage ſhewed by the <hi>Rebels;</hi> which they had only opportunity at that time to expreſſe by a loud ſhout. Beſides, they were treble their number, and had for their leaders <hi>Roger Moore, Hugh Birne,</hi> and <hi>Philip O-Rely,</hi> the two laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had been trained in the Warres abroad under the Spaniſh Diſcipline, and were of greateſt experience among them: they brought down a great part of thoſe Forces out of the Counties of <hi>Cavan</hi> and <hi>Monagham,</hi> and as ſoone as they came within the River of <hi>Boyne,</hi> great numbers of the ordinary churles of the <hi>Pale</hi> adjoyned themſelves unto their men, and ſo made up a body ſufficient to performe that ſervice.</p>
               <p>The newes of this unhappy defeat was brought the very ſame day being munday the 29 of <hi>November</hi> at evening, to the Lords Juſtices as they ſate in Councell: It troubled them very much, and as it was a matter of great rejoycing among the Popiſh Inhabitants of the City, ſo it bred a generall ſorrow and conſternation among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants: It hapned in a very ill ſeaſon, the late made Colonels were but then in raiſing of their men: And ſuch Companies as were compleated, were by the Lords the ſame day of the marching of the 600 men to <hi>Tredagh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Charls Coots</hi> Expedition into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wiclow.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114601:86"/> of that <hi>Iriſh</hi> woman that was there hanged. In his return <hi>Luke Toole</hi> with neare a 1000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> under his command encountred him, but he quickly made them flie and take to the next Bogge with the loſſe of ſome few of their men: And ſo he returned with all poſſible ſpeed to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Lords having ſent him notice of the late defeat given to the Forces ſent to <hi>Tredagh;</hi> As ſoone as he arrived, he applyed himſelfe very carefully to the ſecuring of the Town, which now began to be more deſperately threatned then ever, by the neare approaches of the <hi>Rebels:</hi> And ſo great were the diſorders then in the City, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable the Forces raiſed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants ſo ſtrangly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, the Papiſts ſo highly raiſed in ſpirit and courage, as had the Commanders of the <hi>Rebels</hi> drawn thoſe Forces together as they had in readineſſe on both ſides the River of <hi>Boyne</hi> for the ſiege of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and ſo marching up to <hi>Dublin,</hi> had taken the advantage of the preſent diſtractions, and forward affections which they would have undoubtedly found there to aſſiſt them: They had in all humane probability made themſelves Maſters of the City, and might ſo ſtraightly have begirt the Caſtle, as would within a very ſhort time have endangerd the ſurrender of it; But it pleaſed God to infatuate their Counſells: The ſtrong opinion they had that they ſhould preſently carry <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and ſo poſſeſſe themſelves of all the Armes and Munition they had in that Town, cauſed them to fix their reſolutions there, and to ſet up their reſt upon the obtaining that place. In this as in many other wonderfull acts of divine providence which I then obſerved with great admiration, it pleaſed God to appeare even miraculouſly in the preſervation of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> with the poore remainders of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants, who had there taken ſanctuary.</p>
               <p>And now the Lords and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> thought it high time to diſcover themſelves and their affections to the cauſe: They certainly had not only long entertained a defection in their thoughts, but were as the ſeverall forementioned Examinations teſtifie,<note place="margin">The defection of the Lords and chiefe Gentlemen within the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Pale.</hi>
                  </note> the firſt contrivers and bringers in of the Northern <hi>Rebels</hi> into this execrable Plot; they had now likewiſe drawn them into rhe <hi>Pale,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not hope now much longer to walk under a maske, and entertaine the ſtate with further profeſſions of their loyalty: They had gotten a competent proportion of Armes and Munition out of his Majeſties ſtore into their own poſſeſſion: They ſaw now the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Rebels</hi> advanced within the River of <hi>Boyne,</hi> with very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forces to ſtrengthen their Party, and by the late encounter and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull victory they had therein, they pleaſed their fancies with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conceits of certaine prevailing, if they would now declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>He depoſeth that ſome foure or five dayes after the defeat of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſouldiers at the Bridge of <hi>Gellianſtown,</hi> there iſſued a Warrant from the Lord of <hi>Gormanſton</hi> to the Sheriffe of the County for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meeting of all the Countie at <hi>Dulick:</hi> But the place of meeting was afterwards changed to the Hill of <hi>Crofty,</hi> where all the Lords and Gentry of the Country met, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Fingale,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Slaine,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Lowth,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Dunſany,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Trimbleſtone,</hi> the Lord <hi>Nettervile:</hi> And of the Gentry Sir <hi>Patrick Barnwall,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Bellew, Patrick Barnwall</hi> of <hi>Kilbrew, Nicholas Darcy</hi> of <hi>Plattin, James Bath</hi> of <hi>Acharn, Garret Ailmer</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>Cuſake</hi> of <hi>Gormanston, William Malone</hi> of <hi>Leſmullin, Sedgrave</hi> of <hi>Kileglan, Linch</hi> of the <hi>Knos, Lynam</hi> of <hi>Adamſtown, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Doudall</hi> of <hi>Athlumney, Nicholas Doudall</hi> of <hi>Brownſtown</hi> this Examinates brother, and him this Examinate with a multitude of others, to the number of a 1000 perſons at the leaſt, whoſe names he this Examinate cannot for the preſent call to minde. And after about two or three houres ſpent upon the ſaid Hill of <hi>Crofty</hi> by the Lords and Gentry aforeſaid: There came towards them, Colonel <hi>Mahowne, Philip O-Rely, Hugh Boy-Rely, Roger Moore, Hugh Birne,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Fox,</hi> attended on with a gard of Musketiers:<note place="margin">Theſe were ſome of the chiefe Leaders among the Northern <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi>
                  </note> And this Examinate ſaith, That as ſoone as the parties drew neare unto the ſaid Hill, the Lords and Gentry of the <hi>Pale</hi> rode towards them, and the Lord of <hi>Gormanſtone,</hi> being one of the firſt, ſpake unto them, and demanded of them, Why, and for what reaſon, they came Armed into the <hi>Pale;</hi> Vnto which <hi>Roger Moore</hi> made preſent Anſwer, That the ground of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, and taking up Armes, was for the freedome and liberty of their conſciences, the maintenance of his Majeſties Prerogative, in which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114601:87"/> they underſtood he was abridged, and the making the ſubjects in this Kingdome as free as thoſe in <hi>England</hi> were: whereupon the ſaid Lord of <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> deſired to underſtand from them truly and faithfully, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe were not pretences, and not the true grounds indeed of their ſo doing, and likewiſe whether they had not ſome other private ends of their own; which being by all denied, upon profeſſion of their ſincerity, his Lordſhip the Lord of <hi>Gormanſton</hi> then told them: Seing theſe be your true ends, we will likewiſe joyn with you therein: unto which courſe all agreed. And thereupon it was publikly and generally declared, that whoſoever ſhould deny to joyn with them, or refuſe to aſſiſt them therein, they would accompt him as an Enemy, and to the utmoſt of their power labour his deſtruction. And this Examinate ſaith, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the agreement ſo made as aforeſaid, There iſſued another Warrant to the Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> to ſummon all the Lords and Gentry of the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> to be at the Hill of <hi>Taragh</hi> about a week after; and accordingly there met at the ſame place the Earle of <hi>Fingale,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Gormanston,</hi> and the reſt of the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aforenamed, together with Sir <hi>Thomas Nugent,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>Birford</hi> the Lawyer, and a multitude of others; and the work of that day was firſt to make Anſwer to a Summons made by the State for the calling of the Lords unto <hi>Dublin,</hi> which Anſwer was brought ready drawn by the Lord of <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> and preſented by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and being peruſed by the ſaid Councell at Law was ſigned by the Lords.</p>
               <p>In this manner was this great tranſaction moſt ſolemnly conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated betwixt <hi>Lemſter</hi> and <hi>Vlſter; Valence</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> as Sir <hi>Phelim O. Neale</hi> ſtiles them in his <hi>Characteriſticall</hi> Letter before mentioned, ſent to <hi>Owen Roe O-Neale</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> were now publickly united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in that great Aſſembly. The Lord Viſcount <hi>Gormanſton</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Roger Moore</hi> on the other, had both been long tampering about the drawing of this moſt important work to the forme it now received, they had at length brought it unto perfection, they two had the glory of it, and appeared the great publike inſtruments of this powerfull union.</p>
               <p>The Lords and chiefe Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> having thus farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves became ſo high and preſuming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nicholas White</hi> Eſquire Sonne and Heire to Sir <hi>Nicholas White</hi> of <hi>Liſlip,</hi> was the firſt that gave the example about the ſecond of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi> but he carried the matter ſo handſomely, as his Company ranne away to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> as he pretended, without his conſent or even his knowledge any longer time before their departure, then to give him opportunity to come and acquaint the State therewith, and his own diſability to hinder the ſame:<note place="margin">The reaſons why the State Summond the grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of all the Lords of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then in the City of Dublin.</note> But before it was poſſible to uſe any meanes of prevention, the men were all gone with their Armes and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the <hi>Rebels:</hi> Many of the other Captaines deſired no ſuch fine cover for their intentions, but delivered themſelves and their Armes up to be diſpoſed as they ſhould direct without any further ſcruple or complement to the State: Whereupon the Lords finding how notoriouſly they were abuſed by the very great confidence repoſed in ſuch Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> as being made Captaines, had received Armes from them, and perceiving what courſe they began now to ſtear, and how they were reſolved to imploy their own Armes againſt them, they took ſuch order, and with ſuch celerity and diligence made ſtay of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall of thoſe Armes, which were delivered out for the uſe of the <hi>Pale,</hi> as of the 1700 Armes diſtributed among the ſeverall Counties thereof they recovered againe into their hands 950.</p>
               <p>And now by reaſon the Northern <hi>Rebels</hi> had ſettled their Camp within the River of <hi>Boyne,</hi> and ſo lay betwixt <hi>Tredagh</hi> and the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> all entercouſe in the <hi>Pale</hi> was interrupted, the paſſages ſtopt up, and the Lords Iuſtices and Councell underſtood very little or nothing of any proceedings held there. They therefore finding their dangers daily to encreaſe through the near approach of the <hi>Rebels</hi> unto the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the continuall affronts, and new ſcornes the State dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received from them, their own want of ſtrength to repreſſe their bold attempts, or to preſerve the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> round about them out of their bloody hands, reſolved now in theſe their high extremities, to try the effects of thoſe large proteſtations and great profeſſions of loyalty the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> had lately made unto them, and to give them a faire opportunity of rendring a moſt acceptable ſervice to his Majeſty and the ſtate here. For this end therefore they determined to call a grand Councell of all the Lords which reſided within any convenient diſtance of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> clearly and freely to repreſent unto them the ill condition of their affaires, and how highly it imported them in reſpect
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114601:88"/> of their own particular ſafety, as well as for the preſervation of the whole Kingdome, not only to contribute their beſt advice and councell, but even all the Forces they could any wayes raiſe towards the beating of the Northern <hi>Rebels</hi> out of the <hi>Pale.</hi> Severall Letters of Summons were accordingly writ and ſent away to the Earle of <hi>Fingale,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> and the reſt of the Lords of the <hi>Pale;</hi> the tenour of them here enſueth.</p>

               <p>In Anſwer to this Letter, the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, out of their unfained deſires to give unto thoſe Lords all due ſatisfaction, and to remove thoſe jealouſies and great miſunderſtanding now grown up between them,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iſſued out by the Lords Iuſtices and Councell for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Lords of the <hi>Pale.</hi>
                  </note> thought fit by way of Proclamation to publiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them and all others of his Majeſties good Subjects of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion, That they never heard Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> or any other ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the Board or elſewhere, any ſuch ſpeeches tending to a purpoſe or reſolution to execute upon thoſe of their profeſſion, or upon any other a generall Maſſacre or any Maſſacre at all, and that they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to diſhonour his Majeſty and this State, or wound their own conſciences as to entertaine the leaſt thought of acting ſo odious, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deteſtable a thing upon any perſons whatſoever; and that if any proofe can be made of any ſuch words ſpoken by any perſon whatſoever, that he ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed. And therefore that they did pray and require the ſaid Noblemen to attend them at the Board, on the 17. day of <hi>December,</hi> that they might conferre with them: And for the ſecurity of their repaire unto them, they did thereby give to all and every of thoſe Noblemen, the word and aſſurance of the State, that they might then ſecurely and ſafely come unto them without danger of any trouble or ſtay whatſoever, from them who neither had nor have any intention to wrong or hurt them.</p>
               <p>But now it began to appeare unto the Lords Iuſtices and Counſell, how farre they were engaged with the Northern <hi>Rebels.</hi> By the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations taken of ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who made their eſcape out of thoſe parts the newes of their ſolemne contract and Aſſociation beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was brought up to <hi>Dublin:</hi> And they then well enough diſcerned the maine obſtruction in their comming, the cauſe of their tergiverſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what good reaſon they had to finde out excuſes to <hi>palliate</hi> their <hi>diſloyalty.</hi> They then expected no other fruits of their Proclamation then what it produced: Neither indeed had it any other effect and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among them, then that they did with great boldneſſe and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by way of Anſwer thereunto, write back a Letter to the Lords Iuſtices wherein they pretend themſelves ſo juſtly affrighted with Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> ſeverity and deportment,<note place="margin">Severall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> to colour their refuſall to repaire to the Lords Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Councell.</note> as that they dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture themſelves within the confines of his government: They heavily impoſe upon him the inhumane acts perpetrated as they terme them in the County of <hi>Wiclow,</hi> the Maſſacre of <hi>Santry</hi> and the burning of Mr <hi>Kings</hi> houſe and his whole ſubſtance at <hi>Clantarfe,</hi> and with a little kind of cunning, they ſeeme to pretend a breach of the publike faith, but would transferre the blame from the Lords Iuſtices to Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and therupon deſire no ſiniſter conſtruction may be made of their ſtay,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114601:89"/> and that they may have ſome Commiſſioners appointed to conferre with them, and ſo conclude with ſome profeſſions of their Loyalty and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to give their advices for the advancement of his Majeſties ſervice, and the common peace of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This was an Anſwer, ſuch as might juſtly be expected to come from perſons ſo deeply now involved in the guilt of ſo high a Rebellion.<note place="margin">The great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence-uſed by the Lords Iuſtices and Councell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lords of the <hi>Pale.</hi>

               <p>Theſe propoſitions being taken into conſideration in the Houſe of Commons, after they had duly conſidered of them, and weighed the high neceſſities of this Kingdome, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had 2500 men ready raiſed, and that they could not ſo ſuddenly make proviſion any other way for the ſaving <hi>Ireland,</hi> as by ſending theſe Forces out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they readily condiſcended unto them, and having voted them ſeverally, they ſent them up to the Houſe of Peeres, with their deſires for a ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in them.</p>
               <p>Theſe beginnings gave great hopes of the ſudden reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it was now generally beleived, that conſiderable Forces would be tranſported within a very ſhort time out of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the defence of the Northern parts of this Kingdome; eſpecially conſidering with how much earneſtneſſe his Majeſty in his Speech made to the Lords and Commons in Parliament on the 14 of <hi>December,</hi> in this preſent yeare, had preſſed them to take to heart the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and offered unto them whatſover his power, paines or induſtry could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the good and neceſſary work of reducing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation to their true and wonted obedience.</p>
               <p>But alas theſe great expectations were ſoone daſhed,<note place="margin">The Forces deſigned for <hi>Ireland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded.</note> and the Forces deſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well out of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtrangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by ſeverall obſtructions which daily aroſe in the tranſaction of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> affaires.</p>
               <p>For firſt, his Majeſty in the ſame Speech, wherein he conjured them, by all that was deare to him or them, to goe on chearefully and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the reducing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did take notice of a Bill for preſſing Souldiers for <hi>Ireland</hi> depending in the Houſe of Peeres, and declaring his diſlike of putting it in that way, told them he would paſſe it ſo were there a <hi>ſalvo jure</hi> put into it both for the King and people, but withall, told them that he thought him ſelfe little beholding unto him whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, that began this diſpute ſo farre trenching upon the bounds of his ancient and undoubted prerogative.</p>
               <p>Theſe paſſages in his Majeſties Speech were deeply reſented, not only by the Lords, who were more particularly concerned in them, but by the Houſe of Commons: And therefore his Majeſty had no ſooner ended his Speech and left their Houſe, but that the Lords fell into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſame, and reſolved that the King by taking notice of the debate in their Houſe of the Bill, concerning preſſing of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, had broken the fundamentall priviledges of Parliament. And preſently a Meſſage was brought unto them, likewiſe by Mr <hi>Hollis</hi> from the Houſe of Commons, to deſire a conference with their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips by Committees of both Houſes touching the Priviledges of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114601:94"/> Parliament: At the conference they fully expreſſed the deep ſence they had of the high injury offered unto them, by his Majeſty in invading their Priviledges, and proceeded ſo farre as to come not only to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majeſty, and to deſire that hee would be pleaſed to make known that perſon who had given him information ſo unduly of what had paſſed in their Houſe: but alſo, to make a Proteſtation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Priviledges: This took up ſome time, and the great miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding even which then began to appear betwixt his Majeſty and the Parliament, had ſo ſtrong an influence into the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as notwithſtanding the high neceſſities of this Kingdome, and the great affections expreſſed by the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> for our ſudden reliefe here, the reſolutions were ſlow, and the preparations went ſo heavily on, as it was long before the Houſe of Commons could finde meanes to enable the Lord Lieutenant to ſend ſo much as one Regiment away out of <hi>England,</hi> for the defence of the Caſtle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> then much diſtreſſed by the neare approach of the <hi>Rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for the Forces to be ſent out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of this Kingdome, they meet with ſeverall obſtructions likewiſe.<note place="margin">The debate of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preſented by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Houſe of Peeres.</note> For firſt, the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> had not power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them from the State there to Treat for the ſending over a leſſer number then 10000 men, which the Lords here were very unwilling to condiſcend unto. But this obſtacle was ſoone removed by the zealous affections of the Houſe of Commons, who as ſoone as the Propoſitions brought in by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were preſented unto them, voted their aſſent to Treat for the ſending of the number of 10000 men out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the inſtructions given to the Commiſſioners by that Kingdome, and ſent up a Meſſage to the Houſe of Peeres by Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> Knight, to lay before their Lordſhips, the miſerable eſtate of the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to let them know that the Houſe of Commons conceived the beſt way for the preſervation of it out of the hands of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> was ſpeedily to diſpatch the <hi>Scots</hi> into the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and therefore deſired that they would joyn with them in the Propoſitions received from the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>Upon the receit of this Meſſage, the Houſe of Peeres fell upon the ſaid Propoſition, and after a long debate, it was at length agreed that 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> if the Houſe of Commons would condiſcend that at the ſame time there might 10000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> men bee as ſpeedily ſent likewiſe thither, and thereupon deſired a conference with the Houſe of Commons, that they might fully underſtand their reſolution therein, which being yeelded unto by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114601:94"/> the Houſe of Commons, The Lords at the conference preſſed with much earneſtneſſe, that they might be aſſured of the ſending over of 10000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the ſame time that the <hi>Scots</hi> were to be ſent away: whereunto the Houſe of Commons replyed, that they were not to be capitulated withall, that their actions were free as well without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as capitulations, that they thought they had given ſufficient cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty already of their reſolution to ſend that number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore deſired that their Lordſhips would Vote the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away of 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> by it ſelfe without any relation to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpoken of by them.</p>
               <p>This took up a large debate in the Houſe of Peeres, and was one maine cauſe of the ſlow proceeding on of the Treaty with the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners. I ſhall not undertake to determine at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from whence theſe obſtructions grew, but I am very ſure wee could here eaſily finde, that there were ſome ſuch ſecret workings under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand againſt the good affections expreſſed by the Houſe of Commons, and by the Lords who were well affected to the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as that this Treaty was very much retarded thereby, and was not brought on to any concluſion in many Moneths after. So as in the meane time, all the Britiſh planted thorough out this Kingdome, were deſpoiled, driven out of their habitations, or moſt cruelly murdered within their own doores: and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtrengthned themſelves in all parts of the Country, and prevailing everywhere, drew many to joyne with them, that had hitherto kept themſelves in a kinde of Neutrality, as ſuppoſing that the State here would be altogether deſerted, and no Forces at all ſent out of <hi>England</hi> for the ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as had taken up Armes in this quarrell.</p>
               <p>The whole Province of <hi>Munſter</hi> about the midſt of this Month of <hi>December,</hi> began to declare themſelves in open Rebellion.<note place="margin">The revolt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the Province of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </note> The Lord Preſident there, had uſed his utmoſt endeavours to ſuppreſſe their very beginnings, but by reaſon of his want of ſtrength was now able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them no longer: Hee did with all diligence and carefulneſſe labour to prevent the joyning together of any numbers of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in any of thoſe parts: And when he underſtood how they began in ſome places of the Province to deſpoyle the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they had neare <hi>Waterford</hi> gotten away many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mens cattell, and were carrying them out of the limits of his government, he thought it not fit longer to ſit ſtill, but gallantly purſued thoſe <hi>Rebels</hi> in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being accompanied only with his own Troop of horſe, and ſome few Gentlemen of the Country, who joyned with them, and after a long and tedious march came upon them unawres, ſlew 200 of thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:114601:95"/> reſtored the cattell to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were owners of them, and took ſeverall priſoners whom he hanged for a greater terrour to all ſuch as ſhould adventure afterwards to follow their example: As ſoone as he had done this ſervice, his Lordſhip retired back to <hi>Cork,</hi> having neither Forces nor meanes to make any further proſecution: which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> well enough underſtood, and therefore drew together in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places of that Province, and though they did not in that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner,<note place="margin">The miſery ſuffered by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Munſter.</hi>

And for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who ſtood upon their guard and immured themſelves up in ſeverall Caſtles of good ſtrength in thoſe Parts, they endured many Months ſiege, ſuffered much want and miſery, and having bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted all the aſſaults and attempts that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> made with great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes upon them, and in many places cauſed them to raiſe their ſieges with great loſſe and ſlaughter of their men: yet they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, finding themſelves without all hope or poſſibility of reliefe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to deliver thoſe places together with the multitudes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> they had received, into the hands of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> upon faire quarter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly promiſed by them: And in many places no ſooner had they by that meanes gotten entrance into them, but that they moſt perfidiouſly broke the quarter given, deſpoyled them of that little remainder of their ſubſtance they had then left, and ſent them away in great want and miſery to find reliefe among other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſons. But the whole Country being waſted and deſtroyed, and the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> that lived in them, deſpoiled of all their ſubſtance, were become ſo miſerable and poor, as that they were able to afford them very little reliefe or comfort, beſides pitty and compaſſion which could not ſupport or keep alive thoſe languiſhing gaſtly Creatures, ſo as multitudes dyed, ſome in ditches, ſome travelling on the high-wayes, ſome under hedges, and ſo left their Carkaſſes as fearfull ſpectacles to the beholders, and ſad monuments of the inhumane cruelties exerciſed on them by thoſe bloody <hi>Rebels,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114601:95"/> who yet under pretence of mercy ſpared their lives, but took up a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as they were not aſhamed to declare, to put them to a more lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring death, and therefore left them in ſuch a condition as inevitably brought on their miſerable ends with much more diſcomfort and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>But this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew the beginning of the riſing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in <hi>Munster;</hi> the particulars whereof ſhall be clearly and at large ſet down in the following Relations of their firſt proceedings within that Province, where it ſhall be declared likewiſe, how all the great Towns in <hi>Lemſter,</hi> except <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Tredagh,</hi> did about the ſame time begin to ſtrip and expell all the Britiſh and Proteſtants, that either inhabited in them or fled out of the Country neare about to ſhelter themſelves there, from the barbarous cruelties of their <hi>Iriſh</hi> neighbours.</p>
               <p>As for the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> it began now to be much more ſtraightly encompaſſed by the Forces of the <hi>Rebels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

And here I cannot without much griefe of heart call to mind the lamentable complaints and bitter out-cryes, which untill this time, were continually ſent up unto the Lords Juſtices and Councell, while they remained in this poſture, out of ſeverall Parts of the Country, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants being by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> driven out of their habitations, had for their preſent ſafeguard put themſelves into Houſes or Caſtles of ſome ſtrength; they there enduring much want and miſery, made ſhift though not without great difficulty by ſeverall Meſſages and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to make known their condition to the State, as alſo that they were reſolved as many of them did, to ſuffer the utmoſt extremities out of hope of reliefe, and a confident expectation of ſuccours from them.</p>
               <p>But alas all was in vaine, they were able to afford them no other comfort then what their pittifull commiſeration of their ſorrowfull condition would adminſter; they were themſelves reduced ſo low, as with the greateſt power they could raiſe, they durſt not adventure to ſend any wayes five miles out of the City, their ſupplyes out of <hi>England</hi> were not arrived, they had neither place nor meanes to raiſe men, but only within the virge of the City, and ſuch as they ordinarily took up there, were either <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whereof many ran preſently away with their armes to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> or poore ſtripped <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Inhabitants of this City who were raw men, and though they afterwards being well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and trained to the uſe of their armes, proved very good ſouldiers; yet
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114601:96"/> for the preſent they were very unfit for ſervice: As appeared in that little expedition Colonell <hi>Craford</hi> made out with his men to <hi>Finglas,</hi>

               <p>BY our Letters of the third of <hi>December,</hi> we made known to your Lordſhip, that Mr <hi>Hawtrige</hi> was then newly arrived with the Treaſure ſent us from thence, which came but to ſixteen thouſand five hundred foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and tenne pounds, a ſupply of Treaſure farre ſhort of that which is now become neceſſary to performe any conſiderable ſervice here againſt the <hi>Rebels,</hi> whoſe numbers are increaſed wonderfully, inſomuch as the Forces they have about <hi>Drogheda</hi> on all ſides it, and between <hi>Drogheda</hi> and this place, reaching even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foure miles of this City, are upon very credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, conceived to be above twenty thouſand men, and beſides thoſe numbers who are ſo united between this and <hi>Drogheda</hi> and thereabouts, there are many thouſands of them diſperſed the whole Kingdome over, for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of people firſt riſe generally; and then thoſe of better quality follow after; and the fire which was firſt kindled in <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and lay awhile ſmothered in other parts, begins now to break out ſo generally, as the defection now appeares to bee univerſall throughout the whole foure Provinces; ſo ſtrangly rooted was the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114601:97"/> combination, and that ſtrengthned under the ſpecious ſhew of a Warre for Religion; for although before and ſince the Caution wee had from your Lordſhip, We have on our part endeavoured not to give any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> doth intend to make it a Warre of Religion, yet as we formerly made known to your Lordſhip, the <hi>Rebels</hi> labour mainely to have it ſo underſtood. Nay, they now goe ſo farre as they call themſelves generally the Catholike Army, a Title which hath drawn many thouſands to their party, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny joyned with them for no other reaſon then becauſe they ſaw our Succours expected forth of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> deferred, they rightly judging, that without thoſe Succours, we are not able to defend them our ſelves; and indeed untill thoſe Succours come, they muſt and will ſtill encreaſe; but if our men and armes were once arrived, the very countenance of their comming would draw many from them to us, and give ſome ſtop to the fury, with which they yet carry all before them whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they come.</p>
               <p>They continue their rage and malignity aganſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and Proteſtants, who if they leave their goods or cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell for more ſafety with any Papiſt, thoſe are called out by the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and the Papiſts goods and cattell left behind; and now upon ſome new Councells taken by them, they have added to their former, a further degree of cruelty, even of the higheſt nature, which is to Proclaime, That if any <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhall harbour or relieve any <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that be ſuffered to eſcape them with his life, that it ſhall bee penall even to death to ſuch <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and ſo they will bee ſure though they put not thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> actually to the ſword, yet they doe as certainly and with more cruelty cut them off that way, then if they had done it by the ſword; and they profeſſe they will never give over untill they leave not any ſeed of an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:114601:97"/>
               <p>Nor is their malice towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> expreſſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but further even to the beaſts of their fields, and improvements of their hands, for they deſtroy all Cattell of <hi>Engliſh</hi> breed, and declare openly, that their reaſon is, becauſe they are <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo great is their hatred, not onely to the perſons of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alſo to every ſpecies of that Nation, and they deſtroy all improvements made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and lay waſte their habitations.</p>
               <p>Wee formerly ſignified to your Lordſhip, that to take away all jealouſie from the Papiſts of the <hi>Engliſh Pale,</hi> we would furniſh them with ſome Armes, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee well know that in the laſt great Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Pale</hi> ſtood firme to the Crowne of <hi>England;</hi> and that the Rebell <hi>Tyrone</hi> in the heigth of his power and greatneſſe, was never able to get into the <hi>Pale</hi> with his Forces whilſt hee was in Rebellion; and upon this occaſion, the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> making deep profeſſions of their loyalty to his Majeſty, in imitation of their Anceſtors, and with expreſſions ſeeming to abhorre the Contrivers of this Rebellion here againſt whom they offered their power and ſtrength, ſo as they might have Armes; and we being well aſſured, that if wee could gaine their concurrence with us, it would much facilitate our work; wee did at their earneſt ſuit iſſue for them Armes for one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, wherewith divers Companies were armed by them, and ſome of them ſelves were appointed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Forces of the Counties, and Captaines of their Compaines; but ſo many of thoſe Companies revolted to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and carryed away their Armes with them, as we have recovered back but nine hundred and fifty Armes; ſo as thoſe whoſe loyalty We had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect would help us, are now through their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloyalty turned againſt us, and are ſtrengthned with our own Armes; and without all queſtion, if thoſe of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114601:98"/> 
                  <hi>Engliſh Pale</hi> had done their parts as became good ſubjects with their Armes they had from us, and thoſe they might gather amongſt themſelves, they might with our help not only have defended the <hi>Pale</hi> againſt the <hi>Rebels,</hi> but might alſo have prevented the ruine and deſtruction wrought by their Tenants and Neighbours on the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants amongſt them; for the Noblemen and Gentry ſate ſtill and looked on, whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants were ruined before their faces; the Papiſt in the meane time remaining ſecure, without the loſſe of goods, or any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>When wee ſaw the power and ſtrength of the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſtill growing upon us more and more, and approaching by degrees more neare to us, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants robbed and ſpoyled even within two miles of this City, in diſdaine and affront of this State, which are ſcornes of ſo high a nature as we could not endure, if we had ſtrength ſufficient to repreſſe their inſolencies; and when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the retarding of our Succours of men and armes from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> neither of both Succours being yet come, nor as we heard ſo much as in view there or in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and when we found apparantly that for want of thoſe ſupplies, we became in a manner ſo contemptible, as we were in danger to be ſet upon for taking from us this City and Caſtle before our aides ſhould come, wee be-thought us of all the meanes we could of gaining time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident that wee cannot be ſo deſerted by the State of <hi>England,</hi> but that ſome ſupplies may yet come unto us: And therefore on the third of <hi>December,</hi> we directed our Letters to divers of the Nobility of the Kingdome who were neareſt to us, and moſt of them being of the <hi>Engliſh Pale,</hi> to be with us here on the eight day of this Month, that we might conferre with them concerning the preſent ſtate of the Kingdome, and we hoped by their help, to handle the matter ſo as we might gaine a few dayes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114601:98"/> time before our ſuppriſall here, by which time in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood our Succours might arrive, although it be boldly given out by the <hi>Rebels,</hi> that we ſhall have no Succours from thence, which they divulge to enbolden their party, and to ſtrike terror and diſcouragement into the well-affected, amongſt whom there are many ſo weak, as to apprehend from thence too much feare, whereby many are fled the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>On the eigth day of this Moneth, the Earle of <hi>Kildare,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Fitz-Williams,</hi> and the Lord Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Houth</hi> came unto us, but the reſt of the Noblemen not comming deferred our conference, and on the eleventh day of this Month we received Letters from ſeven of them, namely, the Earle of <hi>Fingale,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſton,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Slaine, Trimbleſtone, Dunſany</hi> and <hi>Lowth,</hi> dated the ſeventh day of this Month, and ſigned by them, pretending a feare of a Maſſacre on thoſe of their Religion, and that therefore they are deterred, to wait on us, but doe rather think it fit to ſtand upon their guard, and how that reſolution of theirs may ſtand with the loyalty they profeſſe, wee humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Majeſtie's excellent judgment, for whoſe royall view wee ſend you here incloſed, a Copy of their ſaid Letters.</p>
               <p>When we received thoſe Letters, we did admire whence their feares of comming to us ſhould ariſe, but afterwards we heard that they had been in conſultation with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> which alſo as to moſt of them is confirmed by the encloſed Examination of <hi>Chriſtopher Hampton,</hi> and indeed we know no cauſe of feare they have of us, unleſſe their own guilts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in them the feare they pretend; and they ſpare not though unjuſtly to charge us with a neglect of their adviſes, whereas not one of them to this Houſe offered to us any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or reall aſſiſtance towards Pacification of theſe troubles.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114601:99"/>
               <p>It became then publike (nor could wee keep ſecret that which they had publiſhed to others) that thoſe Noblemen ſo farre ſided with the <hi>Rebels</hi> as they now ſtood on their guard; wee therefore adjudged it fit for vindicating the State from the aſperſion which we found ſo publikely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be laid upon us, to publiſh the encloſed Proclamation, as well to ſatisfie to the world as thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, who certainly are abundantly ſatisfied in their own ſecret thoughts, that wee never intended to Maſſacre them or any other; that being a thing which we and all good Proteſtants doe much abhorre, what ever the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Religion is, and hath been found to be by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience in other parts, whereof we confeſſe we are now in great danger; if our long expected Succours come not the ſooner to us, and it may be gathered from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled tyranny which the <hi>Rebels</hi> have already exerciſed towards thoſe of our Nation and Religion, who fell into their hands, what we for our parts may expect from them; but the diſhonour and ſhame which may reflect upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation by expoſing this State and Kingdome to ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ruine, and with it the extirpation of Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, afflicts us more then the loſſe of our own lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, when all might be ſaved by ſending ſeaſonably thoſe Succors.</p>
               <p>Wee lately received Letters from the Lady <hi>Ofaly,</hi> and a Letter containing moſt inſolent Menaces incloſed therein, ſent her from the <hi>Rebels,</hi> to which ſhee ſent them a noble Anſwer, Copies whereof we ſend here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</p>
               <p>One of the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſtiling himſelfe Chaplaine Major and Overſeer of the Coaſts and Harbours, lately ſent a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in a proud and vaunting manner, to one <hi>Edward Leech,</hi> that was entruſted to keep the Iland of <hi>Lambay,</hi> requiring the delivery up of that Iland to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> which being done, he gave <hi>Leech</hi> a Paſſe, where in he ſtiles the <hi>Rebels</hi> Forces the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114601:99"/> Army: A copy of which Summons and Paſſe we ſend your Lordſhip here incloſed; and <hi>Leech</hi> told us that that mighty Chaplaine declared openly to him, That he was Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Rebellion, That he had ſpent in Travell and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that deſign beyond Seas foure thouſand pounds; and that all the Kings in Chriſtendome, excepting the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> have hands in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p>A Caſtle in the Town of <hi>Langford,</hi> held by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſtood out awhile againſt the <hi>Rebels,</hi> being in the end through want of victuals neceſſitated to be rendered up to them upon promiſe of quarter, a Popiſh Prieſt ſtanding with his Skeane in his hand, watching for the comming forth of a Miniſter then amongſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> did by thruſting that Skeane into the Miniſters guts, and ripping up his belly, give that as a ſignall to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> for falling upon the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which they did accordingly, aſſoone as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was murthered, killing ſome, and hanging the reſt moſt perfidiouſly.</p>
               <p>On the ninth of this Month, we received advertiſement, that great numbers of men were gathered together in War-like manner at <hi>Swoords</hi> in the County of <hi>Dublin</hi> within ſix miles of us, they having the Army of the <hi>Rebels</hi> behind them on this ſide <hi>Drogheda;</hi> whereupon we then immediately ſent out our Warrant, commanding them to diſperſe: A Copy whereof we ſend your Lordſhip here incloſed, which was not obeyed; but a Letter ſent us from <hi>Luke Nettervile</hi> Sonne to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Nettervile</hi> and others of them: A Copie whereof we likewiſe ſend here incloſed; whereupon we publiſhed the incloſed Manifeſt, for vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this State from their aſperſions alſo: And it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thoſe Gentlemen at <hi>Swoords</hi> could even on that very Tueſday night, wherein they alledge they were ſo affrighted at their Houſes, aſſemble twelve hundred men together in that moment of time, to have in readineſſe againſt any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114601:100"/> from the State, whereas for many dayes before, they could ſit ſtill and look on, whilſt an Army of the Enemy lay behind them, betwixt them and <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and whilſt ſome of them openly declared <hi>Rebels,</hi> and many of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who doubtleſſe hold under-hand intelligence with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> robbed and ſpoiled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on all parts round about them; and yet thoſe Gentlemen could not in all that time be either ſo affrighted by the <hi>Rebels,</hi> or ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate of their poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> neighbours, as to aſſemble any men for the defence of themſelves, or thoſe their poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> neighbours; and certainly thoſe Gentlemen might have been as believing in this State who have alwayes uſed lenity and mildneſſe towards them, as in the Forces of the <hi>Rebels</hi> which lie ſo neare behind them, and who they know have murthered many of his Majeſties good and innocent Subjects, and for ought they know (if there were not ſecret intelligence between them) might have uſed them alſo in like manner.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, we conceive thoſe Gentlemen had a minde to joyn with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and doe now take up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to cover their diſloyalty, and caſt ſcandall on this Government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> in the <hi>Pale</hi> as in other parts, have cauſed Maſſes to be ſaid openly in the Churches, expelled the Miniſters from Officiating in their Churches, and forced divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſaving their lives and goods to become Papiſts, openly profeſſing that no Proteſtant ſhall be ſuffered to live in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and whilſt they inſult thus over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtants, deſtroying them for no other reaſon, but for that they are Proteſtants and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we let fall nothing againſt them touching Religion, and yet they faine things againſt us, tending that way to give ſome colour to their cruell proceedings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> of the County of <hi>Kildare</hi> have taken the <hi>Naas</hi> and <hi>Kildare</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare.</hi> The <hi>Rebels</hi> of <hi>Meath</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:114601:100"/> have taken <hi>Trim,</hi> and <hi>Aſhboy</hi> in the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> and divers other places; The <hi>Rebels</hi> of the County of <hi>Dublin,</hi> have poſſeſſed <hi>Swoords</hi> and <hi>Rathcoole,</hi> and ſpoyled all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and Proteſtants even to the Gates of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and now about fifteen hundred of the Rebels of <hi>Wiclow</hi> are in and about <hi>Powerſcait,</hi> and about ten miles from this City; There are alſo between this and the <hi>Naas</hi> within ſix or ſeven miles of us a thouſand of the Rebels of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and the Borders of <hi>Wiclow</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo as we are in this City invironed by them on all ſides by Land, and they begin to ſtop acceſſes to us by Sea; for the Fiſhermen on the Sea Coaſts being all <hi>Iriſh</hi> and Papiſts Inhabitants in the <hi>Pale,</hi> brake out alſo into Rebellion with the multitude, and have robbed, ſpoyled and pillaged even within the Bay of <hi>Dublin</hi> ſeverall Barkes comming hither forth of <hi>England.</hi> And if to revenge this villany on the Fiſhermen at <hi>Clantarfe</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, ſo neere us, we ſend forth a Party of Souldiers to burn and ſpoyle thoſe Rebels houſes and corn, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Pale</hi> will immediately take new offence; but that we will adventure upon; for now there is no dalliance with them, who ſo farre declare themſelves againſt the State, not caring what ſcorns are put upon the Government, wherein is obſervable, that the Landlord of <hi>Clantarfe</hi> is one of thoſe Gentlemen riſen in Armes at <hi>Swoords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip now ſees not only the neceſſity of haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with all poſſible ſpeed our Succours of men and armes, both out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in greater numbers then thoſe at firſt deſigned, ſeeing the breach appeares to be farre greater, and the defection more generall then at firſt was conceived; and yet ſo as ſuch of them as are ready be not forced to ſtay for the reſt, but that thoſe may be ſo ordered as to come after, for no fleſh can imagine, unleſſe they ſaw it as we doe the greatneſſe of our danger, who are but a handfull in compariſon of the multitudes riſen againſt us: And we deſire that the ten thouſand deſigned to come from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:114601:101"/> may be wholly ſent away, as well the five thouſand intended to be left there in readineſſe as the reſt, with direction to land as neare <hi>Dublin</hi> as they may, and whereſoever they land to march to <hi>Dublin</hi> if poſſibly they can; And to ſend away with all ſpeed the Ships appointed for guarding theſe Coaſts, is alſo very neceſſary to be haſtned, and that two or three Ships of good ſtrength follow after; doubtleſſe theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> expect a very great ſupply of Armes and Munition from forraign Parts, either <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although out of the fore-ſight we had of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſince theſe troubles began, we have endeavoured to get in ſome proviſions of victuall and corne, yet we have not been able to provide our ſelves ſufficiently to ſtand out any long ſiege, nor can we now get in any more, our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets being almoſt taken away, and the ſtrength of the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſurrounding us ſo as wee can fetch in no more proviſions; wherefore we beſeech your Lordſhip that the Magazins of Victuals deſigned to be ſetled on that ſide, may be ſetled wirh all ſpeed, if it be not done already, whereby we and the Succours we expect, may not be in diſtreſſe of Victuals for our ſelves or them, or oates for our horſes. Our want of Victuals is the more in reſpect of the daily acceſſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpoyled in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of the defence of the Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> required the immediate raiſing of a Regiment of Foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one thouſand men, and two Troops of Horſe of threeſcore each Troop, which threeſcore we appointed the Lord Preſident to raiſe, and for the payment and arming of of them, wee humbly adviſe, ſeeing we cannot doe it, that money and armes be ſent from thence to <hi>Youghall,</hi> with a further ſupply of Armes and Munition for the ſtores in that Province now much wanting there.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Rebels</hi> which have be ſet us and this City on all ſides by Land, doe threaten to cut off our Market at <hi>Dublin,</hi> which we begin to feele already: ſo they boldy declare, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114601:101"/> they will within a day or two cut off the watercourſe, which brings water to this City and Caſtle; and that done, that their multitudes will immediately burn our Suburbs and beſiege our Walls, which we confeſſe we yet want ſtrength to defend, and muſt want till our Supplies come forth of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> or both; for here we have but about three thouſand men, the reſt of the old Companies being diſperſed in ſeverall needfull Garriſons in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (excepting ſeven Companies of them ſurpriſed, and cut off by the <hi>Rebels</hi> at their firſt riſing in <hi>Vlſter</hi> and other Parts) and about two hundred horſe by pole of the old Army, whereof many are <hi>Iriſh:</hi> ſo as conſidering the ſpaciouſneſſe of this City and Suburbs to be defended, the ſmalneſſe of our number to defend them, and the great numbers of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Inhabitants in this City and Suburbs; and laſtly, the very great numbers of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> who are ſo ſtrong as to approach this City with many thouſands, and yet leave many thouſands alſo at the ſiege of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to bee able to defend this City for any long time againſt them, without the arrivall of our expected Succours.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Caſtle-haven</hi> on the tenth of this Month, preſented at this board the incloſed Oath tendered unto him by the <hi>Rebels</hi> to be ſworn by him, which he ſaith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſweare, and we heare they ſend it to all Parts to be tendered to the people, preſſing them to take the Sacrament thereupon.</p>
               <p>We did lately in hope to gaine ſome time untill our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies might come, liſten to an offer made by ſome Popiſh Prieſts to goe to the <hi>Rebels</hi> and Treat with them, as you may perceive by the incloſed: But ſince we finde there is little hope of it; for ſome of the Prieſts are returned, nothing being wrought thereby.</p>
               <p>However it is fit your Lordſhip ſhould know what wee doe; we muſt now crave leave to declare to your Lordſhip,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114601:102"/> that things being riſen here to this heigth, threatning not onely the ſhaking of the Government, but the loſſe of the Kingdom, as the Supplies of men, Armes and more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are of great neceſſity to be haſtned away hither; ſo is it alſo needfull that we enjoy your Lordſhips preſence here, for the conduct in your own perſon of the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affaires of this State, as well in the Martiall as in the Civill Government, which doe neceſſarily require it in this time of great imminent danger, wherein ſo farre as we may be able to contribute any aſſiſtance with you, we ſhall be ready to diſcharge our duties therein, with that loyalty and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteneſſe of heart which we owe to his Majeſty, and the particular reſpect due from us to your Lordſhip; but we hope you will bring that ſtrength with you, which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the greatneſſe of the King our Maſter to ſend with his Leivtenant againſt ſo numerous enemies as theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> are become, as well for the honour of his Majeſty, as for the terrour of thoſe <hi>Rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what we have heretofore and now humbly repreſented to your Lordſhip, you may in part ſee the greatneſſe of the publike danger wherein this Kingdom now ſtands, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly this City and Caſtle, the principall piece thereof, that if thoſe be loſt (which we now againe aſſure your Lordſhip, were never in ſo great perill to be loſt ſince the firſt Conqueſt of this Kingdom by the Crown of <hi>England</hi>) the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt quickly follow, that the danger which muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſe to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> is very great in many reſpects. There is no poſſibility to prevent thoſe evils with honour and ſafety to <hi>England</hi> but by Succours from thence or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or both, and that if thoſe Succours come not ſpeedily, it cannot be avoyded, but the Kingdom muſt be loſt. And if notwithſtanding all this ſo often and truly made known by us to your Lordſhip, we ſhall periſh for want of Supplies, we ſhall carry this comfort with us to our graves or any other buriall we ſhall have, that your Lordſhip can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114601:102"/> witneſſe for us to the Royall Majeſty and to all the world that we have diſcharged our duties to God, to his Majeſty, to that Nation, and to this, in humbly repreſenting to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by your Lordſhip, the chiefe Governour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the extremities and dangers wherein his Kingdome and people ſtand, and the neceſſity of haſtning Supplies hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by all poſſible meanes for preſervation of both, ſo as what ever become of our perſons, our memory cannot be juſtly ſtained with ſo wretched a breach of faith and loyalty to the King our Maſter, as to forbeare repreſenting thither the extremities wherein we are, whether we have the credit to be believed or no; and that we write truth, and moſt needfull truth, will be found true, when perhaps we ſhall periſh, and which is more conſiderable, the Kingdome alſo for want of being believed and ſuccoured in time. And ſo we remaine</p>

                  <hi>BY our Letters to your Lordſhip of the</hi> 22 <hi>of</hi> November, <hi>We did deſire to be enformed from thence, whether the Parliament here being once Prorogued, may not againe be prorogued by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation before they ſit, or whether it be of neceſsity that they muſt ſit againe, and the Parliament to be Prorogued the Houſe ſitting. And now that this Rebellion hath over-ſpread the whole
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114601:103"/> Kingdome, and that many members of both Houſes are involved therein, ſo as the Parliament cannot ſit. We humbly deſire to know his Majeſties pleaſure therein, and if his Majeſty ſhall think fit to Prorogue it, which in preſent we hold expedient, that then we may receive his commandment for Prorogation, and that the doubt concerning that be cleared; for to aſſemble at that time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Letters of the third of</hi> December, <hi>have been hitherto with-held on this ſide by contrary winds.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>In this moſt miſerable condition, the Lords Juſtices and Councell continued ſhut up within the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſtrugling with all their power for a ſhort preſervation from thoſe diſmall calamities which had generally over-ſpred the whole Kingdome: Their care, travell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, had hitherto in ſome meaſure extended to the moſt remote parts; how they might aſſwage the ſwelling diſtempers, or yeeld ſome reliefe to the lamentable complaints and bitter out-cryes daily brought up unto them. But now the evils abroad were grown paſt their cure, and their own dangers ſo multiplyed as they were enforced to ſpend their time almoſt in a perpetuall conſultation, never at reſt, ſometimes raiſed in the night by ſudden advertiſements, alwayes in conſtant perplexity and trouble, deſperately threatned on every ſide, ſo as what through treachery within or from without, they had juſt reaſon to apprehend the loſſe of the City and Caſtle wherein they had encloſed themſelves, and ſo conſequently the ruine and deſtruction of all the Britiſh and Proteſtants throughout all other parts of the Kingdome. And thus they continued untill the moſt happy and welcome arrivall of that truly valiant Gentleman and gallant Commander Sir <hi>Simon Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The arrivall of Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> with Forces out of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> who being deſigned Governour of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> was diſpatched away by ſpeciall Order of Parliament with his Regiment for the preſervation of that place, and landed here on the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> 1641, to the great joy and comfort of all his Majeſties Proteſtants, and well affected Subject, and to the terrour of thoſe <hi>Rebels</hi> now in Armes, who had made themſelves believe that no Succours would be ſent out of <hi>England</hi> towards the ſuppreſſing of their notorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>And now my intentions were to have proceeded further on in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down what hath fallen out within the next foure Months, and then to have added a briefe account of all ſuch particular paſſages as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114601:103"/> have been acted during the ſpace of thoſe ſix Months within all the ſeverall Counties of this Kingdom, and ſo having recollected and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were at one view the publike calamities and miſerable deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of all the foure Provinces there, to have ſate down and made the firſt period of this Story.</p>
               <p>But I muſt here take up being unexpectly called away; I reſolve therefore patiently to attend the reſtoring of this Kingdome and the reſettlement of our affaires, and then if I find not this work under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and perfected by ſome more skilfull hand, I ſhall hope to get the reſt of my tailing together, and make ſuch further proviſion of all other materialls as may enable mee to goe through with the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the meane time it will not be amiſſe to take notice, that the <hi>Rebels</hi> within very few Moneths after their firſt breaking out, had ſo ordered their affaires, as that by their ſudden ſurpriſes, their ſharpe and bloody executions, their barbarous ſtripping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſpoyling of all ſorts that fell into their hands, they had cleared the Inland Counteys of all the Britiſh Inhabitants: And except ſome few Caſtles and other places of ſtrength which they held ſeverally beſieged, and had moſt of them ſuddenly after ſurrendred for want of reliefe, they had in a manner made themſelves abſolute Maſters in all thoſe Parts of the Kingdome. And for the Maritime places, there were only ſome of the chiefe Cities which were held out againſt them, beſides ſome few other Forts and places of no great importance: As in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Cork, Youghall,</hi> and <hi>Kinſale;</hi> in <hi>Vlſter, London-Derry, Colraine</hi> and <hi>Caregfergus:</hi> And all theſe they held either beſieged, much diſtreſſed, or they were otherwayes ſo over-peſtred with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of poore ſtripped people fled to them for ſafety, as they were confident they could not long hold out, but that either open force, treachery, famine, or ſickneſſe would within a ſhort time inevitably put them into their hands.</p>
               <p>Thus it pleaſed God to humble his own people in this Land, and for their ſinnes to give them up into the power of their cruell Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who began now to ſacrifice to their own ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, to celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their Victories: And upon the proſperity of their undertakings and late ſucceſſe, they were become ſo confident of prevailing even to the totall extirpation of all the Britiſh and Proteſtants out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as they proceeded to ſet down a certaine form of Government, nominated the perſons whom they intended to entruſt with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their affaires, what Lawes they would have revoked,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114601:104"/> what Statutes newly enectad: And in the meane time they erected a Councell which they ſtiled the Supreme Councell, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with abſolute Power and Authority, to order and governe the whole Kingdome. This conſiſted of certaine Noblemen, Gentlemen, three or foure Lawyers, and one Phyſitian, who being elected unto this charge, had the place of their reſidence appointed unto them at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> a City in the Province of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> where they ſate ordinarily for the diſpatch of all the great and weighty affaires of their State: They there erected ſeverall Courts of Judicature, they made a new broad Seale, appointed ſeverall great officers of State, coyned money, ſettled an exciſe upon all kinde of commodities, and performed many other acts of regall power.</p>
               <p>Now how they proceeded on in the ordering theſe their great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires what Councels they took, what meanes they uſed to enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make oppoſition againſt the Forces ſent over by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> into all the foure Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall here forbeare to ſpeak of. Theſe particulars muſt be reſerved for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing part of this Story, where they will moſt properly fall in to be related: And where likewiſe, we ſhall finde ſo ſtrange a turn, ſuch a remarkable declination of their power, their hearts failing them for feare, their Councells infatuated, their deſigns blaſted, their Forces routed their ſieges raiſed, ſuch a generall defailliance and inproſperity in all their undertakings, as we muſt needs give glory to our Maker, and acknowledge that God hath moſt wonderfully wrought for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the poore ſmall remnant of his people, which were here ſhut up and deſigned to the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>For after a conſiderable number of Horſe as well as Foot ſent over by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and had in ſome pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty encounters thereabouts tried the mettaile of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and found their ſpirit of a poore and baſe allay, they began extreamely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them, and would be no longer abuſed with the fabulous reports of their great ſtrength or numbers which with much advantage they had long made uſe of: Therefore now they began to ſeek them out in all places, and whereſoever they came to meet with them, they alwayes prevailed even with ſmall numbers very often againſt great multitudes of them, ſparing not many times to purſue them into the midſt of their greateſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tneſſes, and made the very bogges and woods unſafe recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for their broken Troopes. And with ſo great ſucceſſe, was the warre proſecuted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the firſt landing of their Forces out of <hi>England</hi> untill the Treaty of that moſt unhappy Ceſſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1643. as that in all the incounters they had with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114601:104"/> 
                  <hi>Rebels</hi> during that time, they never received any ſcorn or defeats, but went on Victoriouſly, beating them down in all Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And ſo they carried on their work before them without any aſſiſtance either from the meere <hi>Iriſh</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh Iriſh:</hi> For I can not my ſelfe remember any Gentleman of quality throughout the whole Kingdome that was there born and breed up a Papiſt that put himſelfe into that ſervice, or deſired to be liſted as a member of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. It is true, ſome of the common Souldiers there, were of the <hi>Engliſh Iriſh</hi> that came in, and though they were not conſiderable for their number, yet they did good ſervice and ſtill with much fury and ſharpneſſe followed on upon the execution.</p>
